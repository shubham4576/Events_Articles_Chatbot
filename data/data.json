    "social_media_description": "<strong>Flexera Reimagines Software Supply Chain Safety \u2013 </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Embeds Open Source Security Scanning into Software Development Build Process</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\r\n\r\n<em>Developers Go from Zero to Hero with FlexNet Code Aware,</em>\r\n\r\n<em>Now Integrated with InstallShield<sup>\u00ae</sup> and InstallAnywhere<sup>\u00ae</sup></em>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Itasca, Ill. \u2013 May 10, 2017 \u2013 </strong><a href=\"https://www.flexerasoftware.com/producer/?utm_source=GlobeNewswire&amp;utm_medium=PR&amp;utm_campaign=FlexNet%20Code%20Aware\">Flexera</a>, the company that\u2019s reimagining the way software is bought, sold, managed and secured, announced today it\u2019s reimagining software supply chain safety. Flexera\u2019s the first-in-industry to embed open source security into the heart of the software development build process with automatic analysis detection.\u00a0 It will help keep the software supply chain secure by enabling 100,000 developers around the world to sell clean products, free of open source vulnerabilities and license compliance risk.\r\n\r\n\u201cFor nearly three decades, Flexera\u2019s InstallShield product line has been ubiquitous in every software company\u2019s development process. With our FlexNet Code Aware release, Flexera is extending our customers\u2019 capabilities to do a quick scan for open source vulnerabilities and issues <em>at the time the application is being packaged</em>,\u201d said Jim Ryan, Chief Executive Officer at Flexera.\u00a0 \u201cIn providing this capability, we are making it easier for software producers to gain unprecedented insight into what is in their code which they can, in turn, share with their customers.\u00a0 Driving collaboration between software producers and their customers is essential to eliminating the waste, inefficiency and risk that currently exists in what can only be described as a dysfunctional software supply chain.\u201d\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.flexerasoftware.com/producer/products/software-installation/flexnet-code-aware/?utm_source=GlobeNewswire&amp;utm_medium=PR&amp;utm_campaign=FlexNet%20Code%20Aware\">FlexNet Code Aware</a> is the leading automated, open source risk assessment and package discovery solution helping software developers quickly scan products for security and Intellectual Property (IP) compliance risks. FlexNet Code Aware is now integrated with Flexera\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.flexerasoftware.com/producer/products/software-installation/installshield-software-installer/?utm_source=GlobeNewswire&amp;utm_medium=PR&amp;utm_campaign=FlexNet%20Code%20Aware\">InstallShield</a> and <a href=\"https://www.flexerasoftware.com/producer/products/software-installation/installanywhere/?utm_source=GlobeNewswire&amp;utm_medium=PR&amp;utm_campaign=FlexNet%20Code%20Aware\">InstallAnywhere</a> solutions. InstallShield is the global standard used by 100,000+ developers for creating Windows desktop, server and cloud installers on more than 500 million devices.\u00a0 InstallAnywhere is the leading solution for creating multiplatform installation experiences for physical, virtual and cloud environments.\r\n\r\nBy embedding FlexNet Code Aware into InstallShield and InstallAnywhere, open source security scanning is now a standard part of the software build process, helping developers discover and assess IP and vulnerability risks <em>before</em> products ship.\u00a0 This powerful, combined solution sets the foundation for a vulnerability-free build, ensuring a smooth, error-free installation.\r\n\r\n<strong>Eliminating Open Source Risk Early \u2013 Really Matters</strong>\r\n\r\nThe use of open source components in software development is skyrocketing. A decade ago, developers were using less than 100 open source libraries per release.\u00a0 Today, some industries are using more than 1,000.\u00a0 In addition \u2013 developers are often not aware of the risks contained in the open source code they use.\r\n\r\nAccording to Flexera data, as much as 50 percent of code used in development is open source \u2013 code developers didn\u2019t write themselves. And as a whole, developers are only aware of up to four percent of the third-party software that comprises their products.\u00a0 As open source dependency increases, developers need to be good corporate citizens and truly understand the vulnerability risk and compliance requirements they are inheriting from the open source code they use.\u00a0 FlexNet Code Aware \u2013 now integrated with InstallShield and InstallAnywhere, identifies the libraries developers are using, and what the associated licensing terms are to ensure compliance.\r\n\r\n\u201cOpen source security and compliance can\u2019t be a once-a-year process \u2013 it simply doesn\u2019t cut it any more given today\u2019s demanding time-to-market pressures. Build/release engineers are the last people to touch products on a daily basis before they are packaged for installation. Up until now they haven\u2019t really been able to do much around open source vulnerability management,\u201d said Jeff Luszcz, Vice President of Product Management at Flexera. \u201cThese engineers are the front-line of defense in the development process and should be front-soldiers in ensuring open source security and compliance.\u00a0 With FlexNet Code Aware now embedded in InstallShield and InstallAnywhere, Flexera helps them find vulnerabilities as part of their ongoing, daily builds \u2013 without slowing them down. \u201d\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n# # #\r\n\r\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://info.flexerasoftware.com/IS-CONTACT-FlexNet-Code-Aware?utm_source=GlobeNewswire&amp;utm_medium=PR&amp;utm_campaign=FlexNet%20Code%20Aware\"><strong>Contact Flexera</strong></a><strong>, and follow the company on\u2026</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/company/574962\">LinkedIn</a></li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/flexerasoftware\">Twitter</a></li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Flexera-Software-244409926422/?fref=ts\">Facebook</a></li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/+flexera/posts\">Google+</a></li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https://www.xing.com/companies/flexerasoftware\">Xing</a></li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http://www.flexerasoftware.com/company/newscenter/news-feeds.htm\">RSS</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong>A</strong><strong>bout Flexera Software</strong>\r\n\r\nFlexera Software\u2019s business sits at the nexus between the world\u2019s software producers and buyers \u2013 repairing the broken software supply chain, which is the most dysfunctional supply chain in all of business today. That dysfunction manifests as risk and cost \u2013 to both the producers of software and the enterprises that buy software \u2013 as they solve the complex, time consuming, and expensive problems of ensuring licensing compliance and security from vulnerabilities.\u00a0 Our software licensing, compliance, cybersecurity and installation solutions are essential to ensure continuous licensing compliance, optimized software investments, and to future-proof businesses against the risks and costs of constantly changing technology.\u00a0 A marketplace leader for more than 25 years, 80,000+ customers turn to Flexera Software as a trusted and neutral source of knowledge and expertise, and for the automation and intelligence designed into our products.

More and more, law firms and corporate legal departments have jettisoned their legacy platforms and adopted DISCO as their firm-wide or company-wide ediscovery solution. DISCO is now the acknowledged market leader in next-generation cloud ediscovery.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\"We are thrilled to bring Andrew\u2019s and Michael\u2019s leadership to DISCO,\" said founder and CEO Kiwi Camara. \"Both share our core values \u2013 what we call the Inventor\u2019s Spirit \u2013 and both are mature, effective leaders with remarkable track records throughout their careers to prove it. In addition, I couldn\u2019t be more proud of Neil\u2019s accomplishments with us. When we searched for a CMO, we concluded the best candidate was already here.\"</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\r\n</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Shimek, DISCO\u2019s new CRO, is a lawyer and a 20-year industry veteran who held successive leadership roles at LexisNexis and Epiq, ending as President of Legal Services and Electronic Discovery at Epiq. At DISCO, Shimek\u2019s focus will be growing revenue worldwide. \u201cI am thrilled to be here to help build out the offering and team as we expand our market footprint around the world and become the dominant player in ediscovery,\u201d said Shimek. \u201cWhen I met the DISCO team and saw a clear passion and commitment to bring product differentiation back to ediscovery, the pull was too great to resist.\u201d </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\r\n</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Lafair, DISCO\u2019s new CFO, previously served as the Chief Financial Officer of Offers.com and was instrumental in executing the sale of Offers.com to Ziff Davis, LLC in 2015. After the acquisition, Lafair served as Global Head of Finance, Ziff Davis B2B. Prior to Offers.com, Lafair served as Chief Financial Officer and General Counsel of All Web Leads, Inc. and Vice President and General Counsel of Interlogix, Inc. and practiced corporate law at Morgan, Lewis &amp; Bockius LLP. With the addition of Shimek and Lafair, two thirds of the DISCO executive team are former practicing lawyers.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cMichael is both a lawyer and a highly regarded financial executive. We are delighted he will be joining DISCO,\u201d said Camara. \u201cHe has key experiences and a unique skill set in moving companies forward from a financial and investment standpoint, and we look forward to seeing his contribution to DISCO.\u201d Lafair said, \u201cI am pleased to join Kiwi and his team. I was impressed by DISCO\u2019s innovative and transformative approach to using technology to improve the practice of law. I look forward to helping this talented team continue its success.\u201d</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Etheridge, assuming the role of CMO, has been with DISCO since 2015 and has been instrumental in the growth of the company as Vice President of Marketing. In his new position, he will continue to lead DISCO\u2019s go-to-market strategy, brand strategy, lead generation, product marketing, communications, and more \u2013 both domestically and internationally. \u201cNeil is the kind of transformative visionary who helps businesses such as ours quickly position themselves for go-to-market success,\u201d said Camara. \u201cHe has a track record of accomplishments in coordinating internal and external resources and stakeholders to capture and grow market share. We would not be where we are today without him.\u201d</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For more information, or to learn more about DISCO </span><a href=\"http://info.csdisco.com/schedule-demo\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">contact us</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> today.</span>\r\n\r\n<b>About DISCO</b><b></b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As the leading provider of Software as a Service solutions developed by and for lawyers and legal professionals, DISCO partners with law firms and corporate legal departments to improve legal outcomes by building and deploying great legal technology.

    "social_media_description": "<h2><strong>New Year, New Perspectives on Blockchain Technology in Legal\u00a0</strong></h2>\r\n<h4>by Rabiya Hirji-Young and Adrienne Girone</h4>\r\n<a href=\"https://27fz7121tk8u1tib9t2po42i-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/pexels-photo-534204-e1515440111141.jpeg\"><img class=\"wp-image-1878 alignright\" src=\"https://27fz7121tk8u1tib9t2po42i-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/pexels-photo-534204-e1515440111141.jpeg\" alt=\"gavel\" width=\"387\" height=\"252\" /></a>By all accounts, 2017 was an explosive year for bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, and blockchain technology. Within the <a href=\"https://www.law.com/legaltechnews/sites/legaltechnews/2017/12/20/whats-next-for-the-law-and-blockchain-in-2018/?kw=What%E2%80%99s%20Next%20for%20the%20Law%20and%20Blockchain%20in%202018&amp;et=editorial&amp;bu=Law%20Technology%20News&amp;cn=20171220&amp;src=EMC-Email&amp;pt=Afternoon%20Update\">legal industry</a> in particular, interest in these disruptive technologies has grown at an exponential rate, as exemplified by the enormous amount of <a href=\"https://abovethelaw.com/2017/08/in-legal-blockchain-is-the-new-black/?rf=1\">buzz</a> on the subject at <a href=\"https://www.inoutsource.com/iltacon-2017-whats-buzz/\">ILTACON 2017</a>. Amidst all the excitement, we\u2019d like to take a moment to ring in the new year by chiming in with some of our reflections on the possibilities of blockchain technology for law firms.\r\n<h3><strong>Blockchain in Practice </strong></h3>\r\nFirms of varying sizes are striving to position themselves as leaders by demonstrating competency with blockchain and bitcoin. Various large law firms established blockchain practices in 2017, both in response to current interest levels and in anticipation of developments yet to come. Some firms, such as Perkins Coie LLP, have also begun accepting bitcoin as payment, immediately converting payments upon receipt given the cryptocurrency\u2019s high volatility. Toby Brown, Chief Practice Management Officer at Perkins Coie, remarked that these measures are ways of \u201cshowing emerging clients that our firm is on the cutting edge.\u201d\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://27fz7121tk8u1tib9t2po42i-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/pexels-photo-315785.jpeg\"><img class=\" wp-image-1880 alignleft\" src=\"https://27fz7121tk8u1tib9t2po42i-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/pexels-photo-315785.jpeg\" alt=\"bitcoin\" width=\"301\" height=\"207\" /></a>There is also a consensus that <a href=\"https://blockgeeks.com/guides/smart-contracts/\">smart contracts</a> supported on the platform of blockchain technology will be the first level of adoption at law firms. According to Brett Don, Chief Information Officer at Stradley Ronon Stevens &amp; Young LLP, smart contracts have the potential to revolutionize the way transactions and contract negotiations operate in the legal sphere. Blockchain may reduce the amount of time, energy, and resources lawyers need to devote to such transactional work.\r\n\r\nSome in the legal field express concern about smart contracts supplanting lawyers\u2019 places in the legal system. Others view blockchain as an enhancement for lawyers rather than a replacement. Brett raised the example of the US Patent Trademark Office as one such context where, should the USPTO incorporate blockchain technology into the patent/trademark registration process, lawyers might expect to see a more efficient turnover of matters with shorter time frames and greater concentrations of high-level legal guidance comprising hours billed. \u201cOnce blockchain and smart contracts become the norm, there is still a need for lawyers during that transaction, in a different, advisory role. This is actually higher value work for attorneys to engage in,\u201d Brett observed.\r\n<h3><strong>Blockchain and Information Governance</strong></h3>\r\nBeyond practices, smart contracts, and billing, there are many more avenues where blockchain technology might someday aid law firms in managing their internal operations. Max Welsh, Senior Risk Management Consultant at InOutsource and former Deputy General Counsel at Foley &amp; Lardner, envisions a future where blockchain is harnessed to streamline information governance. While he and most industry experts caution that day-to-day adoption by law firms themselves likely won\u2019t occur for some years, Max sees \u201camazing use case potential\u201d from an information governance perspective.\r\n\r\nA pervasive obstacle InOutsource\u2019s clients confront is how to govern data across multiple repositories of record. According to Max: \u201cOne thing we\u2019re always talking about in our client engagements is reducing duplication. Typically, everyone has their own version of a record, which exists as separate records that don\u2019t always align. If there were only one version, that would be unbelievable.\u201d\r\n\r\nTheoretically, blockchain technology could be used to create a single, unified, and verifiable record for transactions relating to information governance, such as file tracking and destruction certifications. Such applications could significantly reduce uncertainty when they are tracked in multiple repositories, some of which may not be firm-approved or maintained consistently. While applications of blockchain in this capacity have a long way to go until they are fully formed, implemented, and enforced, possibilities abound for using this technology to enhance firms\u2019 administrative functions.\r\n<h3><strong>Blockchain and Risk Management</strong></h3>\r\nApproaching blockchain technology from the perspective of risk management is also a vital consideration for law firms. Industry experts have already raised concerns from a data security standpoint, however there is much more at stake under the realm of risk. Many firms have yet to see mention of blockchain technology from clients in client-provided Outside Counsel Guidelines (OCGs) or technology questionnaires, but it is only a matter of time before such instances begin to crop up.\r\n\r\nThe financial sector is expressing <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/615b3bd8-97a9-11e7-a652-cde3f882dd7b\">significant interest</a> in blockchain technology, a trend that will continue its upward trajectory in 2018. It\u2019s also important to note that global banking institutions and other large corporations in the financial sector are often those with the most rigorous OCGs. Therefore, it seems highly likely that law firms wishing to engage such financial institutions on matters in the near future may find themselves seeing blockchain-related provisions in client-provided OCGs. Firms will need to be able to give an informed response to such provisions, both from a legal and an information technology perspective. If such provisions require firms to utilize blockchain technology such as smart contracts on certain types of matters, firms must ensure they have the appropriate technology and administrative solutions in place to comply.\r\n<h3><strong>Resolve to Be on Top of Blockchain in 2018</strong></h3>\r\nAs the big picture on blockchain continues to come into focus, it looks increasingly likely that those who do not keep up with blockchain technology might risk losing business down the line. Though it may take some time, you will feel blockchain\u2019s influence regardless of your firm\u2019s readiness: \u201cI don\u2019t think lawyers are going to be able to avoid it,\u201d Max stipulates. Lawyers, legal support staff, IT personnel, and law firm administrators who devote energy to becoming well versed in blockchain are apt to be the most nimble in adapting to client-driven demands involving the revolutionary technology. InOutsource looks forward to seeing how blockchain continues to influence legal across a range of operational, information governance, and risk management functions.",

    "social_media_description": "<strong>TLT and LegalSifter combine artificial intelligence and legal advice in contract negotiation solution</strong>\r\n\r\nPittsburgh, PA USA | December 13, 2017 LegalSifter has partnered with TLT to launch a \"combined intelligence\" solution for contract negotiation for in-house legal, procurement and operations teams in the UK and Ireland. This world\u2019s first solution will dramatically increase the speed and efficiency of contract reviews and business transactions, and minimize risks inherent in the negotiation process.\r\n\r\nThe solution combines powerful artificial intelligence technology from LegalSifter with in-built legal advice and ad hoc legal support from TLT. Users start by uploading draft contracts into LegalSifter. Sifters \u2013 software trained to read text for a specific concept that learns over time \u2013 and in-context advice from TLT's commercial lawyers then help users to identify missing terms and conditions and make changes that protect their interests.\r\n\r\nThe software completes a contract review within a minute or two, with greater consistency, less risk of errors or missed terms and the assurance that a lawyer is available when needed. It can also be customized to each client \u2013 for example to enforce a company's sign-off procedures \u2013 enabling consistency across the business and can be up and running within a few days.\r\n\r\nJames Touzel, partner and head of technology, media and telecoms at TLT, says: \"People and artificial intelligence together will deliver better results than either alone. Clients will inevitably have questions that software cannot answer, or they will want the assurance that an expert is available when needed. At the same time, artificial intelligence offers a speed that people cannot possibly deliver. That is why TLT has partnered with LegalSifter to create what we believe is the first solution of its kind in the UK and Ireland legal market.\"\r\n\r\nKevin Miller, CEO of LegalSifter, says: \"Contract negotiation is a slow and risky process, and the cost of missing an egregious term can be catastrophic. By combining intelligent software with intelligent lawyers to make contract reviews quicker, safer and cheaper, we're hoping to make this pain a thing of the past. We are excited to be partnering with TLT to bring this new solution to market.\"\r\n\r\nTLT has entered a strategic, multi-year partnership with LegalSifter, which includes a minority equity share in the business. For further information about the solution, please email James Touzel at TLT on james.touzel@tltsolicitors.com or call +44 (0)333 006 0156.\r\n\r\n<strong>About LegalSifter</strong>\r\nLegalSifter is dedicated to bringing affordable legal services to the world by empowering people with artificial intelligence. LegalSifter intends to achieve its mission by working with the legal profession, not against it. Headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (USA), LegalSifter offers its products directly to organizations as well as through and with law firms.\r\n\r\n<strong>About TLT</strong>\r\nTLT supports large corporates, public institutions and high growth businesses on their strategic and day-to-day legal needs. Able to advise across the three UK legal jurisdictions of England &amp; Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, the firm has offices in Bristol, London, Manchester, Glasgow, Edinburgh and Belfast, as well as a specialist ship finance team in Piraeus, Greece.\r\nWith significant experience advising organizations in the energy &amp; renewables, financial services, housing, leisure, public sector, retail &amp; consumer goods and technology, media and telecoms sectors, the firm has a strong track record of consistent growth driven by client need. TLT has more than 100 partners and employs around 1,000 people.",

    "social_media_description": "<strong>LegalSifter and Horty Springer to offer combined intelligence solution to clients needing faster contract review</strong>\r\n\r\nPittsburgh, PA USA | January 9, 2018 LegalSifter and Horty Springer are proud to announce a strategic partnership to offer a new product to help hospitals and health systems in the United States review, analyze and negotiate contracts, starting with business associate agreements required by the HIPAA privacy regulations. By combining LegalSifter\u2019s artificial intelligence with Horty Springer\u2019s legal advice, clients will review contracts 24x7x365 quickly and confidently.\r\nThe partnership represents the first time in the history of the legal services industry in the United States that a law firm will offer artificial intelligence in a format directly used by its clients.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s the next logical step in the use of artificial intelligence in the legal profession,\u201d said Dan Mulholland, Senior Partner at Horty Springer. \u201cClients would like a legal review of every contract they sign, but to do so the review has to be affordable and aligned with the speed of business. Artificial intelligence, with embedded guidance designed by lawyers, is the only way to make that consistently possible.\u201d\r\n\r\nClients will upload a proposed or draft contract into LegalSifter. Sifters \u2013 software trained to read text, look for specific concepts, and learn over time \u2013 read the contract and produce in-context comments written by Horty Springer lawyers in a minute or two. Clients that need additional support will contact Horty Springer for advice.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn every contract negotiation in the world, at least one party works off the other party\u2019s paper,\u201d said Kevin Miller, CEO of LegalSifter. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to read someone else\u2019s writing and apply your point of view without unnecessarily missing a critical term. Our partnership launches a product that makes that process faster and less risky.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn many health care organizations, those responsible for contract negotiation wait days or weeks to have agreements reviewed by their lawyers and colleagues. LegalSifter does it in a minute or two.\r\n\r\nHorty Springer will offer LegalSifter-enabled solutions across a wide range of contract types. The solution will launch with business associate agreements, required under federal law of all health care entities (e.g. hospitals, physician offices, nursing homes, HMOs) that use outside contractors who have access to confidential patient information. In upcoming weeks and months, Horty Springer will offer solutions for practitioner employment agreements, non-disclosure agreements, software end user license agreements, supplier terms and conditions, and many others.\r\n\r\nFor additional information about the product, please contact Dan Mulholland at dmulholland@hortyspringer.com or 412-687-7677.\r\n\r\nAbout LegalSifter\r\nLegalSifter is dedicated to bringing affordable legal services to the world by empowering people with artificial intelligence. LegalSifter intends to achieve its mission by working with the legal profession, not against it. Headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (USA), LegalSifter offers its products directly to organizations as well as through and with law firms.\r\n\r\nAbout Horty Springer\r\nHorty Springer is the first law firm to devote its practice exclusively to health care law. From its offices in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the firm\u2019s 17 attorneys serve hospital and health system clients in all 50 states in association with their local counsel. The firm advises health system physician leaders, executives, boards and legal counsel on a wide variety of matters including medical staff bylaws, credentialing, privileging and peer review, corporate governance issues, regulatory compliance, payor relationships, mergers and acquisitions and all manner of policies and contracts, as well as representing health care clients in contract, antitrust, fraud and abuse and medical staff-related litigation.",

    "social_media_description": "<strong>LegalSifter launches product that reviews contract drafts on other party\u2019s paper in a minute or two\r\n</strong><em>Software-as-a-service product uses machine learning and natural language processing</em>\r\n\r\nPittsburgh, PA USA | September 27, 2017\u00a0 LegalSifter proudly introduces a better way to review and negotiate a contract. At least one party in every negotiation must review someone else\u2019s contract, an unfamiliar document full of complex legal language. That party has three options: (1) ask colleagues or external counsel for help (expensive &amp; slow), (2) review the document alone (challenging), or (3) skip the review, sign the document, and hope for the best (risky).\r\n\r\n\u201cPeople routinely review draft contracts they did not write with tight deadlines, distractions, and the expectation of perfection,\u201d said Kevin Miller, CEO of LegalSifter and a licensed attorney. \u201cOur new product helps people read draft contracts faster, access the advice of their lawyers and leaders in seconds, make fewer errors, and shave days off of their contract negotiations.\u201d\r\n\r\nUsers of LegalSifter upload the first draft of a contract to a secure website. Sifters \u2013 software trained to read text, look for a specific concept, and learn from experience \u2013 then review the document and identify important concepts that demand attention or are missing entirely. The Sifters trigger in-context advice tailored to the customer\u2019s business and position in the negotiation. Users may export the advice for redlining.\r\n\r\nLegalSifter sells its product directly to companies and through law firms. For companies, users tend to be general counsels looking to scale, procurement or sales team members wanting to take a more active role in a negotiation, or leaders who quickly need a second set of eyes on a contract.\r\n\r\nLaw firms are both users and resellers of the product. Junior attorneys and paralegals use LegalSifter to access the experience of their partners 24x7. Partners use LegalSifter just like pilots use checklists in airplanes \u2013 a subtle, important reminder of where they should focus their time and what not to forget.\r\n\r\nLaw firms brand and resell LegalSifter to clients who want to access their trusted advisors on low-level contract reviews at a speed and cost that aligns with their business needs. They combine their advice with the Sifters to create a powerful self-service software product for clients, and improve revenues, client satisfaction, and margins with a new product that makes them money while they sleep.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe will achieve our mission by working with the legal profession, not against it,\u201d said Miller. \u201cArtificial intelligence is becoming part of our daily lives. Amazon brought AI into our homes with Alexa. Apple brought AI to our smartphones with Siri. LegalSifter will start the legal profession on its own artificial intelligence journey.\u201d",

Winners of the competition range in size from individual communicators to media conglomerates and Fortune 500 companies.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMarCom Awards are administered and judged by the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.amcpros.com/\">Association of Marketing and Communication Professionals</a>, an international organization that oversees awards and recognition programs, provides judges and sets standards for excellence.

    "social_media_description": "<b>Time Tracker Legal Software Automation Improves Law Firm Efficiency and Success</b>\r\n\r\n<b>New Jersey, NY \u2013 January 25, 2019</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> \u2013 The 2018 Clio Industry Report asked over 70,000 legal professionals what goals define their firm\u2019s success and 84% placed revenue at the top of the list. Improving the firm's operational efficiency came in just below at 80%. Law firms also consistently struggle to dedicate time to billable work. In an average 8-hour workday, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">utilization rates (the number of billable hours worked divided by the number of hours in a day) was just 30%; a mere 2.4 hours of the 8 hours worked. When you factor in the number of billable hours that don\u2019t get reflected on an invoice and the amounts which never get paid, the average lawyer earns just 1.6 hours in billable work each day. This data suggests strongly the crucial need for improved efficiency and automation to increase revenues and prevent serious profitability issues.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">eBillity\u2019s Time Tracker Legal software enables law firms to automate their time tracking, expenses and billing. The mobile app allows the user to set up push notifications to remind them to track time, and has multi-timers that can automatically track their time by different clients with a push of a button. This automation alone can reduce administration time by up to 10+ hours per month, and by tracking time down to the second, billable hours have proven to increase by up to 20%.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dennis Murphy from Hill Law Firm one of eBillity customers states, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cmy experience with Time Tracker over the past five years has been strongly favorable. I like that I can track my time not only by date but also across matters. The report function allows me to see how much time has been billed to each matter at any given period.\"\u00a0</span></i>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Time Tracker\u2019s free apps for Outlook and Windows 10 allow the user to convert emails and calendar events into time entries and work offline. The product also connects with Apps like IFTTT and Zapier to automate repetitive tasks. Law firms can also automate expense tracking by taking a photo of their receipt and attaching it to an entry and then syncing it with their accounting software for reimbursement and client invoicing. </span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Industry Report also indicates that clients are wanting the ability to check online the number of hours spent on their case, with 50% saying they\u2019re more likely to hire a lawyer who takes electronic payments, 47% more likely to hire a lawyer who accepts automated payments, and 40% saying they would never hire a lawyer who didn\u2019t take debit or credit cards. With Time Tracker law firms can turn their time and expense entries into branded client invoices in seconds, connect their account to Stripe to have payment links automatically added to invoices for immediate online payment. Clients are also able to login to their client portal and view completed work, outstanding invoices and pay bills online.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To complete the time, expense and billing cycle there are also apps that allow firms to automate their accounts receivable. Invoice Tracker by eBillity is an example of one that connects with accounting platforms and practice management software like Clio and Thomson Reuters Time and Billing to improve cash flow by getting firms paid faster. Invoice Tracker sends automatic invoice reminders, accepts online payments and reconciles once payments are made.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cBeing able to showcase our time tracking software specifically built for law firms is exciting for our team, and we look forward to showing legal professionals how automation can improve their law firm\u2019s bottom line, says Douglas Dweck, COO and Co Founder.\u201d</span></i>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.legalweekshow.com/exhibitor/ebillity/\">eBillity</a> will be there at Booth 311 come by to say hi and learn how to automate time tracking, invoices and expenses from anywhere, on any device, with <a href=\"https://www.ebillity.com/\">Time Tracker</a>.

Free for One-Year.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Your small or medium-sized firm can suffer quickly, with long-lasting repercussions, if even one payment is missed. Your cash flow depends on a steady stream of reliable payments so when do you hire a collection agency to deal with your outstanding invoices? What sorts of things should you be doing before that step is even considered? </span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Before you decide to go ahead and look to outside help, it is important to consider whether or not you\u2019ve taken all the necessary steps within your power to collect those overdue payments. This could include things like sending invoice reminders, making phone calls, or sending letters to your client with an increasingly firm tone. But what happens to your billable hours and your client relationships as a result of these manual methods?</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Debt collection is never an enjoyable part of business, but it is necessary for your financial health. It\u2019s hard to know when to tow the line, and when you\u2019re being too firm. Not to mention the time and effort that goes into drafting each email, trying to remember when you need to follow-up and having no idea if they even opened and read your email. </span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Thankfully there are now products that can integrate with your billing software to automate your accounts receivable while maintaining a personal and professional appearance. Products like Invoice Tracker automate your invoice collection process with automated invoice reminder emails, detailed AR reporting, and instant online payment and accounting reconciliation options. </span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Keeping track of your invoicing is essential to increase both profits and billable hours in your law firm.

    "social_media_description": "<strong>Casepoint eDiscovery undergoes a transformative upgrade thanks to the new Casepoint Platform, an entirely new legal technology platform optimized for enterprise-scale application development.</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>\u00a0Tysons, VA \u2013 January 23, 2019 \u2013\u00a0</strong>Casepoint, a leader in providing innovative eDiscovery solutions in a single, cloud-based platform, today announces two major legal technology developments:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.casepoint.com/?utm_source=EdgeRoom&amp;utm_medium=PR&amp;utm_campaign=CPeD-Release&amp;utm_content=PR-1-23-19\">Casepoint eDiscovery</a>\u00a0has undergone a transformative upgrade, bolstered by 10 years of eDiscovery experience and client feedback, and it is the preeminent application built upon the new Casepoint Platform. Casepoint Platform is an innovative technology platform that law firms and legal departments can use to integrate a full range of enterprise applications, documents, legal data, and workflows, into a single flexible platform. With the unveiling of the eDiscovery application rebuilt on the new platform, legal organizations now have the option to create and manage technology to meet their own specifications, from database setup to data processing and all the way through to the end of discovery. Casepoint will unveil both products at Legalweek New York, which takes place January 28\u201331, 2019.\r\n\r\nCasepoint eDiscovery is a full-spectrum eDiscovery solution that features state-of-the-art tools for cloud-based collections, processing, culling, review, and highly customizable productions. It also offers built-in artificial intelligence and analytics that are the most robust in the industry, with advanced tools for TAR 1.0 and TAR 2.0, early case assessment (ECA), and advanced data visualization tools. All customers get the complete package \u2013 there are no features to turn on or pay for later. With Casepoint eDiscovery, legal teams can complete discovery projects faster, at a lower cost, and with greater accuracy using a single, integrated, easy-to-use tool.\r\n\r\nCasepoint eDiscovery is also an infinitely scalable private cloud-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) solution capable of handling millions of documents, multiple terabytes of data, thousands of legal matters, and unlimited numbers of users. Pricing has been structured for maximum transparency, without upsells or user fees. Security is enforced at the company, data center, and application levels, and features military-grade AES 256-bit encryption. Data centers are fully replicated for business continuity.\r\n\r\n\u201cOur eDiscovery technology was already the fastest in the industry, and we\u2019ve now doubled that speed and created an entirely new platform redesigned from the ground up to meet clients\u2019 most pressing needs,\u201d said Vishal Rajpara, Casepoint\u2019s Chief Technology Officer. \u201cWe are confident Casepoint eDiscovery is the best, most thoroughly integrated, and comprehensive solution in the marketplace. We\u2019ve designed our technology to put customers in control. With Casepoint Platform our customers will have access to an incredibly flexible platform that allows them to easily manage matters, tasks and align internal and external users with user-controlled administration. While we know most of our existing customers will continue to request full service from the dedicated delivery teams and project managers they have come to know and trust, we are excited to offer self-service options as well, and everything in between.\u201d\r\n\r\nAttendees at Legalweek will also have the opportunity to demo Casepoint Platform, a fully integrated web-based ecosystem that has been in development for two years. Casepoint Platform is an enterprise-scale application development and deployment environment built upon web APIs and an N+1 scalable architecture. Casepoint eDiscovery runs on Casepoint Platform, and eDiscovery users will feel the benefits immediately. The new platform has been re-engineered to double processing speeds and provide users of the interface with near-instantaneous speed. Law firms and legal departments will have the option to customize the technology to meet their own specifications from database set up to data processing and all the way through to the end of discovery, without incurring extra consulting fees.\r\n\r\n\u201cCasepoint Platform is the foundation of Casepoint\u2019s Law 3.0 vision,\u201d said Haresh Bhungalia, Casepoint\u2019s Chief Executive Officer. \u201cLaw firms and legal departments will use this technology to customize and integrate the entire spectrum of legal workflows, and this will allow them to dramatically streamline operations, control costs at every level, and identify and monitor key performance indicators unique to their organization.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor information about switching to Casepoint from any platform, please click\u00a0<a href=\"http://switch.casepoint.com/?utm_source=EdgeRoom&amp;utm_medium=PR&amp;utm_campaign=CPeD-Release&amp;utm_content=PR-1-23-19\">here</a>.

    "social_media_description": "<a href=\"http://compiled.com/\">Compiled</a> (formerly Compiled Services), the developers of litigation support and e-discovery software <a href=\"http://compiledservices.com/readysuite/\">ReadySuite</a>, announces the release of the latest version of the software with a new \u201cbridge\u201d feature that allows users to retrieve information from the CloudNine\u2122 LAW\u2122 e-discovery platform and import it into Relativity, as well as retrieve field data from Relativity and overlay the data into LAW. This latest version of ReadySuite also offers new features that will save time and improve e-discovery processes for users.\r\n\r\n\u201cCloudNine needed a way for our users to easily import document data, including metadata fields, native files, text files, and image files from data processed in LAW directly into Relativity. We also needed a sync operation to export details like document coding, metadata, tag data, and document files, from Relativity into LAW,\u201d says Brad Jenkins, CEO of CloudNine. \u201cThe experts at Compiled have a reputation for developing tools to accommodate specific e-discovery needs and were able to quickly develop and deploy the solution.\u201d\r\n\r\nOther new features of this latest version of ReadySuite include a new advanced script editor, with code completion and hint capabilities, that makes it easier for users to write their own scripts to address specific workflow needs. The release also adds nine new prebuilt e-discovery scripts.\r\n\r\n\u201cReadySuite is becoming the go-to tool for law firms and e-discovery providers to handle e-discovery workflows,\u201d says Justin Blessing, founder and CEO of Compiled. \u201cWe\u2019ve developed the software to be a neutral tool to integrate e-discovery platforms and were able to quickly deploy the latest version that specifically addresses CloudNine\u2019s integration needs.\u201d\r\n\r\nRepresentatives of Compiled will be at booth #335 at Legalweek, January 29 \u2013 31, to demonstrate the many features of ReadySuite.\r\n\r\nReadySuite is specialized software that allows users an additional measure of quality control when it comes to producing documents for e-discovery. Its features help law firms, government organizations and e-discovery service providers prevent accidental disclosure of redacted documents or those documents that are designated as attorney/client privileged.\r\n\r\n<strong>About Compiled</strong>\r\n\r\nSince 2009, Compiled has created specialized software tools to aid in meeting tight litigation deadlines while adhering to strict quality standards. ReadySuite, the bundled suite of these tools, gives nontechnical and technical e-discovery professionals the ability to perform a number of quality control, load file manipulation and image processing steps to data involved in litigation or regulatory matters. Clients include law firms, e-discovery service providers and in-house legal teams. More information can be found at <a href=\"http://www.compiled.com/\">http://www.compiled.com/</a>.",

    "short_description": "doeLEGAL's whitepaper on \"Smart data, intelligently delivered.\" shows how legal departments can rethink their data and boost legal performance by up to 65%. ",
    "social_media_description": "<h1><strong>Smart data, intelligently delivered.</strong></h1>\r\n<h2><strong>How Corporate Legal is rethinking data and boosting legal performance.</strong></h2>\r\n<em><strong>Data proliferation. Legal analytics.</strong></em>\r\n\r\nData-driven everything.Corporate Legal faces growing business challenges. On one\u00a0hand, these\u2019s so much more data, in more formats, from\u00a0more sources. This adds complexity to how You analyze data\u00a0and handle compliance and security risks. On the other hand,\u00a0there\u2019s pressure to do more with less, requiring better tracking\u00a0and transparency into expenses. This comes as departments\u00a0are managing new and different sources of legal services,\u00a0which adds even more complexity.\r\n\r\nThis heightened demand for information requires data, and\u00a0lots of it. The need to access and analyze rapidly increasing\u00a0volumes of data isn\u2019t new. It has always Been at the heart of\u00a0how law is practiced. But with so much data now available,\u00a0the risk of making decisions based on incomplete information\u00a0continues to rise.\r\n\r\nIn many ways, an inability to harness data for decision making\u00a0can quickly become a legal liability. What\u2019s the risk? Should\u00a0you litigate? Can you improve your business performance?\u00a0Is it worth it? Corporate Legal needs to reconsider what data\u00a0can do for their business \u2014 and how legal analytics hold\u00a0the key to achieving much-needed collaboration, clarity, and\u00a0compliance in a more cost-focused world.\r\n\r\n<em><strong>Effective data use will make the difference.</strong></em>\r\n\r\nAccording to <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/3-steps-to-turn-legal-data-into-insights/\">Gartner</a>, \u201cLegal departments that use analytics\u00a0to inform their decision making exhibit higher work quality,\u00a0reduced litigation cost, and lower spending.\u201d1 Yet, most of\u00a0today\u2019s Corporate Legal departments still employ myriad\u00a0manual processes and disparate data solutions. Few use legal\u00a0analytics and most utilize only a fraction of their data.\r\n\r\n<em><strong>What makes data \u201csmart\u201d?</strong></em>\r\n\r\nData becomes smart when it\u2019s transformed into the insights\u00a0required to propel a business forward. For Corporate\u00a0Legal, this means quick access to everything from high-level\u00a0summaries to granular details on open matters; even financial\u00a0reporting, like aging reports on open invoices. When your data\u00a0is smart, it supports and informs your decisions. It gives your\u00a0team more control over cases and costs. This is what we call\u00a0\u201cSmart data.\u201d\r\n\r\nRather than the bits and bytes trapped in different applications\u00a0and documents, smart data provides a single reference point,\u00a0making it easy to analyze and share information securely\u2014\u00a0across the entire legal team, in-house staff, business-unit\u00a0reps, and outside counsel. The result: Greater transparency,\u00a0efficiency, and insight.\r\n\r\n<em><strong>\u201cIntelligent delivery\u201d makes smart data actionable.</strong></em>\r\n\r\nCreating smart data is only half the battle. You also must make\u00a0the smart data available to everyone on the team, where they\u00a0are, when they need it, in the optimal format for their individual Needs.\r\n\r\nIntelligent delivery makes smart data comprehensive, accurate,\u00a0and actionable. It\u2019s time for a mind shift: You shouldn\u2019t have to\u00a0change the way you work in order to create and use your smart\u00a0data. Although you may already rely on a legal information management\u00a0solution, it may not accommodate the ways your\r\ndepartment needs to work.\r\n\r\nTruly intelligent delivery enables any user to determine what\u00a0smart data they need and how they will receive it \u2014 all within\u00a0access parameters you specify. In other words, intelligent\u00a0delivery serves up timely information related to all matters in\u00a0one place, so teams can quickly compare matter, spend, and\u00a0law-firm data through a single, easily-consumable view.\r\n\r\n<em><strong>Embrace the future.</strong></em>\r\n\r\nResearch from Gartner\u00a0shows that nearly 50%\u00a0of legal departments intend to use analytics for\u00a0process improvement, and more than a third for\u00a0legal analysis.4\r\nDrive your team forward by implementing the\u00a0processes and technologies that enable smart data,\u00a0intelligently delivered. Develop a comprehensive,\u00a0practical long-term plan beginning with your\u00a0end goals in mind. Align your technology and\u00a0process choices around your objectives. Ensure\u00a0that your providers offer the Flexibility you need to\u00a0support your business as it changes and grows.\u00a0These strategies will lay the foundation for process\u00a0improvements, powerful legal analysis, and\u00a0maturing your legal department across the full\u00a0range of <a href=\"https://cloc.org/\">CLOC</a> competencies.",

of its discovery software products.\u00a0 The CloudNine product suite now includes CloudNine LAW\u2122, CloudNine Concordance\u00ae, CloudNine Explore\u2122 (renaming of Early Data Analyzer\u2122 or \u201cEDA\u201d), and CloudNine Review\u2122.\u00a0 New releases of all four technologies will be demonstrated at the CloudNine Legaltech New York booth #310 starting today.\u00a0 Technology announcement highlights include launches of CloudNine LAW 7.0, CloudNine Concordance 10.23 and Concordance FYI Server 5.15, CloudNine Explore 7.0, more features for CloudNine Review, and a new

remarked:\u00a0 \u201cIn March 2018, CloudNine bought the LexisNexis eDiscovery Suite which included LAW, Concordance and Early Data Analyzer.\u00a0 These products joined our incumbent CloudNine Review solution to create an end-to-end eDiscovery solution.\u00a0 Since then, CloudNine has transformed into one of the largest, most comprehensive discovery software providers in the world.\u00a0 At Legaltech New York, we are proud to unveil new names and technology breakthroughs for the CloudNine products.\u00a0 We are committed to aggressively driving development forward to benefit all customers who rely on our technology for their eDiscovery needs.\u201d\r\n\r\n<strong>Launch of CloudNine LAW 7.0\r\n</strong><a href=\"https://ediscovery.co/software/cloudnine-law/\">CloudNine LAW</a> enables clients to process and produce discovery data reliably and confidently.\r\nCloudNine LAW 7.0 includes a multi-core, multi-threaded Turbo Import ingestion engine designed to process and load data up to four times faster than previous versions.\u00a0 LAW\u2019s Turbo Import ingestion will also support multi-agent mailstore and archive processing and support processing of forensic image formats, with reduced infrastructure requirements.\r\n\r\n<strong>Launch of New\u00a0CloudNine\u00a0Concordance\u00a010.23 and Concordance FYI Server 5.15\r\n</strong><a href=\"https://ediscovery.co/software/concordance/\">CloudNine Concordance</a> provides a robust, effective, and cost-efficient way to manage discovery review.\u00a0 CloudNine Concordance 10.23 and FYI Server 5.15 provide capabilities to generate an attachment range for production images.\u00a0 A built-in Concordance Native Viewer allows users to search for documents with redactions and create placeholder images for unsupported file types or missing images during production.\u00a0 CloudNine will also preview new viewer technology to support fast viewing of images and near native files.\r\n\r\n<strong>Launch of\u00a0CloudNine\u00a0Explore 7.0 (formerly called Early Data Analyzer/EDA)\r\n</strong><a href=\"https://ediscovery.co/software/cloudnine-explore/\">CloudNine

and easily.\u00a0 New CloudNine Explore 7.0 adds multi-processing support for PST/OST, MBOX and DBX mailstore formats.\u00a0 Users can also configure Explore 7.0 to send them email notifications when processes are completed.\r\n\r\nCloudNine\u2019s VP of Products and Services Doug Austin said: \u201cWe are renaming Early Data Analyzer \u2018CloudNine Explore\u2019 to reflect the software\u2019s recent transformation since it joined the CloudNine product suite.\u00a0 With growing privacy concerns from GDPR and concerns about #metoo, compliance and investigations have become a huge priority for many organizations today.\u00a0 CloudNine Explore is uniquely able to help companies quickly assess their data and identify areas of risk that must be addressed.\u201d\r\n\r\n<strong>New CloudNine

discovery process by allowing you to upload documents quickly and begin reviewing your document collection within minutes.\u00a0 The enhanced CloudNine Review product includes new interface updates to enhance the user experience.\u00a0 Also, a new managed review set module supports both custom batching needs and advanced reporting on review metrics.\r\n\r\n<strong>CloudNine LAW Integration with Relativity via Compiled's ReadySuite\r\n</strong>CloudNine LAW now integrates with Relativity via a <a href=\"https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/01/23/1704226/0/en/ReadySuite-Offers-Bridge-Between-CloudNine-LAW-PreDiscovery-Software-and-Relativity-to-Simplify-Data-Imports.html\">new

    "social_media_description": "Law firms IT staff struggle to maintain an appropriate security posture as they also spending time answering legal client Vendor Risk Management questionnaires. The uptick in vendor risk management questionnaires seems to have started following the Target data breach that originated with an HVAC vendor.\u00a0 Corporations saw the damage done to Target and corporate executives saw the it could be a career limiting event as the Target <a href=\"https://www.computerworld.com/article/2488275/target-cio-resigns-following-breach.html\">CIO</a> and <a href=\"https://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2014/05/05/target-ceo-steinhafel-out-in-wake-of-data-breach/\">CEO</a> soon departed.\r\n\r\nThe corporate client concern seems valid in light of recent law firm data breach numbers. A <a href=\"https://www.americanbar.org/groups/law_practice/publications/techreport/abatechreport2019/cybersecurity2019/\">2019 statistic</a> from the American Bar Association indicates that \u201c26% of respondents report that their firms have experienced some sort of security breach (including hacker activity and website exploits to more mundane incidents such as lost or stolen laptops).\u201d\r\n\r\nLaw firms are responding to these requirements by looking for an easier way to satisfy their legal clients audits.\u00a0 Arctic Wolf has gained some experience helping law firms tick the appropriate boxes in vendor risk management questionnaires around vulnerability assessment and security monitoring. As the fastest growing managed security service provider (MSSP) according to the 2019 ILTA technology survey, we regularly help our law firm customers to satisfy vendor risk management questionnaires and audits around security.\u00a0 One consistent theme I hear is that the vendor risk management surveys vary.\u00a0 There are no corporate standards around the questionnaires and every enterprise has what they consider to be unique risks to evaluate.\r\n\r\nThere are tools available such as the ILTA <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiIl-fd2prnAhVFtZ4KHb_-CCIQFjAAegQIBBAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Filta.personifycloud.com%2Fwebfiles%2Fproductfiles%2F2171865%2FUSSPG4_Firm_Security_Assessment.doc&amp;usg=AOvVaw20OaXcQMpNz2yqxN-5Wtgv\">Law Firm Security Assessment Questionnaire</a> to help you understand your security posture.\u00a0 In terms of responding to the security monitoring and vulnerability assessment pieces of the questionnaires, you can \u201croll your own\u201d or you can use a managed service (security operations center (SOC)-as-a-service). Given how lean more law firm IT staffs run, we are finding that SOC-as-a-service offerings like Arctic Wolf act as a force multiplier that offloads considerable work around monitoring and reporting and thus allows IT staff to focus on higher-priority projects.\r\n\r\nStop by <a href=\"https://arcticwolf.com\">Arctic Wolf</a> (Booth #509) to learn more about how SOC-as-a-service can improve your security while allowing you to better answer vendor risk management questionnaires!",

    "social_media_description": "96% of organisations are using cloud-based computing of some form*. How many applications are you using today within your firm that are cloud based? Probably quite a few. Yet why do so many organisations still opt for on premises platforms to store their corporate data? The reluctance to move to the cloud varies from firm to firm, but security is always high on the list. With file sharing platforms and client portals, one of the main reasons to stay on premises is the result of your clients not wanting their data in the cloud. Many firms feel their own, internal infrastructure will be more secure than the cloud. They are in control. However, many articles suggest the cloud is far more secure\u2026\r\n\r\nSo, when choosing a file sharing platform and/or client portal solution which infrastructure should you opt for; Cloud or On Premises?",

Businesses in general benefit immensely when they have higher client retention with it being 6 to 7 times cheaper to retain an existing client than it is to attain a new one (Bain &amp; Company).

    "short_description": "6 Tips for Smarter Contract Management in 2020",
    "social_media_description": "Managing contracts takes a lot of time and effort, especially with the economy booming as we lead in to the year 2020.\u00a0 With this increased workload, contract managers need smarter ways to manage their contracts better.\u00a0 Legal professionals carefully review contracts with a sharp eye for details, excellent reading skills, deep comprehension, business acumen, and sufficient time management skills, but their process can be improved even more with new advancements in contract lifecycle management.\r\n\r\nIt is always beneficial to learn about the latest tools and tips to help us to do our jobs better (and smarter).\u00a0 \u00a0So, as we start the new year, below is a short list of tips to help with smarter contract management in 2020.\u00a0 This is not a complete list but, rather, a series of best practices that can be implemented quickly - and offer a huge return.\r\n<h2><strong>Tip 1:\u00a0 Implement a Contract Intake Process</strong></h2>\r\nThis tip primarily focuses on organizing your contract review process by collecting data in an organized fashion.\u00a0 Legal reviewers receive contract requests in many formats.\u00a0 These formats include emails, paper requests, ticket systems, and sales and procurement systems.\r\n\r\nA quick tip for getting organized is to create a contract intake process.\u00a0 This task includes generating a spreadsheet to collect data fields about the contract you need to review.\u00a0 An efficient contract intake process helps with the tracking of due dates, the status of the contract review, and counterparty (vendor/customer) names.\r\n\r\nIf your legal team has a contract software system, create a contract intake form with input fields.\u00a0 Ask your employees to key in the required contract data fields, upload the file, and have the contract request submitted to you in an organized manner.\u00a0 If you utilized\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.cobblestonesoftware.com/products/enterprise-contract-management-software\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Contract Insight<sup>\u00ae</sup>\u00a0Software</a>, then you already have a Contract Request form process built in.\r\n\r\nContract Request is like a legal form that is web-based and streamlines how your user requests contract review.\u00a0 All you have to do is enable the users in the system and share the link for them to request a new contract review.\u00a0\u00a0 If you do not have a contract software system, then you can utilize a\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.cobblestonesoftware.com/resources/contract-management-tracking-spreadsheet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\u00a0<strong>free contract management spreadsheet</strong>.</a>\r\n<h2><strong>Tip 2: Work in Queues and Lists</strong></h2>\r\nMany employees work sporadically throughout the day, jumping from task to task.\u00a0 Legal reviewers should consider batch processing.\u00a0 Batch processing has been used in many business environments - from the assembly line to modern accounting settings.\u00a0 Batch processing involves queuing up several items that need to be worked on that are related.\u00a0 For example, a legal professional may have to read emails, read contracts, review contracts, draft contracts, research law, and attend meetings throughout their workday.\u00a0 Working on one of these items, then moving on to the next, does not create a rhythm.\u00a0 The worker must jump from one task to another.\r\n\r\nTo help improve contract management in 2020, try to arrange your organization\u2019s work into queues or batches as a productivity tool.\u00a0 If your organization does not have ContractInsight<sup>\u00ae</sup>\u00a0Software, utilize the contract spreadsheet tool mentioned above.\u00a0 Then, check the spreadsheet several times a day and work on the contract reviews in batches.\r\n\r\nIf you have Contract Insight Software, implement a\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.cobblestonesoftware.com/blog/contract-insight-dashboard-launch-pads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">dashboard</a>.\u00a0 A dashboard enables you to create a report of open contract requests (in Tip 1 above) listed by status.\u00a0 Then you pin the report on your dashboard and when you log, you will see the open Contract Requests in a list (like a queue).\u00a0 With dashboards, users can easily view records for requests, legal reviews, and key dates. This will help with smarter contract management this year.\r\n<h2><strong>Tip 3:\u00a0 Utilize Contract Artificial Intelligence and Auto Extract Engine</strong></h2>\r\nFrequently, when a new contract document or legal file must be entered into a system, the user must re-key many data fields, such as the counterparty name, legal description, name, dates, key clauses, governing law, limitation of liability, warranty and other legal fields.\u00a0 To help automate the contract entry process, leverage\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.cobblestonesoftware.com/solutions/contract-management-ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CobbleStone Software's VISDOM<sup>\u00ae</sup>\u00a0Artificial Intelligence</a>.\u00a0\u00a0VISDOM helps users locate key terms and phrases in a contract document and auto-extract terms - based on imported legal phrases - and place the data into the entry fields on the Contract Data Entry screen.\r\n<h2>Tip 4:\u00a0 Leverage Drafting Contracts with Contract Templates</h2>\r\nLegal professionals are tasked with the responsibility of providing legal documents to their vendors and customers.\u00a0 We find that many legal teams have Word documents on a network folder.\u00a0 While this process is helpful, it is better to have a more automated method of drafting agreements utilizing your organization\u2019s contract templates.\r\n\r\nWith Contract Insight<sup>\u00ae</sup>, there is a feature included that automates the contract drafting process.\u00a0 Your organization simply takes its Word contract templates, sets placeholder fields on the documents, uploads the document and\u2026presto!\u00a0 You can merge the contract data fields into the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.cobblestonesoftware.com/products/document-assembly\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">contract template document in Contract Insight</a>\u00a0and route the contract for approval (and electronic signature).\u00a0 For advanced contract authoring, leverage Contract Insight Software\u2019s clause merging functionality to draft and create complex contract documents based on region, the jurisdiction of law, products, and entities (to name a few).\r\n<h2><strong>Tip 5: Use Tasks and Reminders</strong></h2>\r\nOkay, let\u2019s face it, we are all busy.\u00a0 An occasional reminder could be a big help.\u00a0 Well, if your company is using\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.cobblestonesoftware.com/blog/say-goodbye-to-spreadsheets-for-contract-management-2020\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">spreadsheets</a>\u00a0and emails, that is okay, you can still use tasks and reminders.\u00a0 Here is how.\r\n\r\nFirst, utilize Outlook or an email tool that has tasks and calendaring.\u00a0 Set a task or a calendar reminder.\u00a0 Contract Insight\u2019s comprehensive task alerts and reminders regarding contract expiration dates, annual contract review dates, and early warning dates make it so tasks are performed on time by members of your team.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.cobblestonesoftware.com/contract-management-software/contract-workflows\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Contract Tasks and Workflows</a>\u00a0are simple.\u00a0 Workflows track contract records, look for values, and automatically alert users for contract review, expiration notices, and more.\u00a0 As a bonus feature, Contract Insight will e-mail you and your team members task alerts, set calendar alerts with your email provider, and send early reminders.\u00a0 If your organization is looking for the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.cobblestonesoftware.com/blog/how-to-evaluate-the-best-contract-management-software\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">best contract management software</a>\u00a0going into 2020, Contract Insight is the answer.\r\n<h2><strong>Tip 6. Reduce Data Entry</strong></h2>\r\nLegal resources are valuable, so the more time you and your team spend keying in data, the less time you must focus on the strategy-driven review of the contracts.\u00a0 \u00a0So why not enable data integration?\r\n\r\n<em>\u00a0\u201cWait\u2026that sounds hard.\u201d</em>\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, data integration is easy with Contract Insight.\u00a0 Let your vendors and suppliers register online.\u00a0 By leveraging Contract Insight<sup>\u00ae\u00a0</sup>Enterprise, your organization has the option to enable supplier/vendor registration.\u00a0 This feature allows your vendors to key in their company name, contact name, street address, city, state/province, country, postal code, contact email, phone number, tax ID number, and other data fields.\u00a0 This streamlined data integration process can save you thousands of keystrokes per year.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you don\u2019t want duplicate suppliers in your system.\u00a0<em>\u00a0No worries</em>.\u00a0 Simply enable a watcher field, and Contract Insight will prevent duplicate entries.\r\n\r\nMaybe your organization has thousands of customers records each year.\u00a0\u00a0<em>No problem</em>.\u00a0 Just integrate Contract insight with your favorite CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system or enable your customers to register into the customer portal and route the new customer entry to the sales department (and/or legal department) to process the new customer request in Contract Insight Software.\r\n\r\nAlthough each contract data project poses unique challenges, following some basic steps and utilizing a contract database software built for contract management can help.\r\n<h2><strong>Achieve Smarter Contract Management with CobbleStone</strong></h2>\r\nCobbleStone Software provides Contract Insight<sup>\u00ae</sup>\u00a0contract management software as a cloud-hosted (SaaS) or deployed (on-premise) solution.\u00a0 Contract Insight Software is used by thousands of legal professionals for their contract management software needs.\u00a0 Founded in 1995, CobbleStone was among the first and most experienced companies to offer a contract management software product, and we continue to be a leader with full\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.cobblestonesoftware.com/blog/how-contract-management-contract-lifecycle-management-differs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">contract lifecycle management software</a>.\r\n\r\nDiscover CobbleStone\u2019s Contract Insight<sup>\u00ae</sup>\u00a0Contract Management Software and\u00a0<strong><a href=\"https://www.cobblestonesoftware.com/services/contract-data-extraction\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">data extraction</a></strong>\u00a0services.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Written by\u00a0Mark Nastasi\u00a0- Originally Published on CobbleStone Software's Blog</h4>\r\nMark Nastasi is the Executive VP and founder of CobbleStone Software with over 20 years of professional experience in the industry.\u00a0 He launched the first commercial contract software in 1995 named CMTS (Contract Management Tracking System).

    "social_media_description": "Business continues to accelerate globally.\u00a0 The resulting rapidly shifting regulatory environment generates increased risk along with more opportunities, propelling organizations to rely on contracts more heavily to protect business interests and assets.\u00a0 General Counsel and legal teams have a chance to create a new perception of the legal department that moves away from the appearance of a cost center for the organization to the forefront of organizational strategy by leveraging contracts as a growth driver.\r\n\r\nGeneral Counsel has more opportunity than ever to drive value and achieve higher returns by reducing risk, improving efficiency, facilitating collaboration, reducing costs, and increasing revenue with improved contract oversight.\u00a0 Legal documents may include product and material sourcing, distribution agreements, founder/partner agreements, merger and acquisition agreements, and more.\u00a0 The growing challenge is the increasing complexity and volume of contracts combined with an inefficient contract management process.\u00a0 This article identifies General Counsel\u2019s toughest contract management challenges and discusses contract management strategies and tools that can position General Counsel and legal departments to contribute measurable value to their organization.\r\n<h2><strong>A Contract Management Abstract</strong></h2>\r\nTechnology has rapidly advanced; however, too many organizations still rely on manual contract management processes and don\u2019t know where their contracts, or the obligations within them, are stored.\u00a0 This approach puts the\u00a0<strong><a href=\"https://www.cobblestonesoftware.com/products/legal-software\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">legal department</a></strong>\u00a0at a disadvantage when enforcing contracts and assessing risk, leaving them unable to meet their organization\u2019s evolving expectations for success that are focused on probability, adaptability, compliance, efficiency, and cost-sensitivity.\u00a0 General Counsel\u2019s challenges also increase with poor contract management because the C-suite expects General Counsel to assume the role of business leader and partner, while also safeguarding the organization\u2019s integrity and reputation.\r\n\r\nA\u00a0<strong><a href=\"https://www.cobblestonesoftware.com/blog/how-contract-management-contract-lifecycle-management-differs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">manual contract management system\u00a0</a></strong>built around spreadsheets, shared storage, emails, filing cabinets, disparate legal management systems, or repurposed content management systems that lack data connection, do not provide the tools necessary to improve contract management quickly.\u00a0 This approach increases risk and is the cause of missed opportunity, slow review and approvals, contract process bottlenecks, revenue leakage, and compliance failures.\u00a0 Furthermore, manual contract management systems can\u2019t provide General Counsel with the necessary data to answer the C-suite's questions about milestones, market disruption, acquisitions, financing, and security.\r\n\r\nAn alternative to manual contract management is to implement a leading enterprise contract management system that integrates contract management software with document assembly, vendor management, and electronic signatures.\r\n<h2><strong>General Counsel\u2019s 7 Toughest Contract Management Challenges</strong></h2>\r\nGeneral Counsel\u2019s core issue may be manual contract management processes and ineffective or non-existent technology, but the day-to-day symptoms may not be as apparent.\u00a0 Following is a breakdown of the top challenges of legal departments and General Counsel. Examples show how contract management software features can help by revealing the clear correlation of challenge and remedy.\r\n<h2><strong>Challenge #1: Compliance</strong></h2>\r\n<strong>Remedy #1</strong>:\u00a0<strong>Dynamic templates and clauses</strong>\u00a0streamline\u00a0<strong><a href=\"https://www.cobblestonesoftware.com/products/document-assembly\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">document assembly\u00a0</a></strong>and ensure the use of approved contract language and clause ownership.\r\n<h2><strong>Challenge #2: Meeting key dates and milestones</strong></h2>\r\n<strong>Remedy #2: Email, task, and calendar alerts</strong>\u00a0ensure review, approvals, signatures, executions, and renewals occur on time, every time.\r\n<h2><strong>Challenge #3</strong>:\u00a0<strong>Completing tasks, reviews, and approvals</strong></h2>\r\n<strong>Remedy #3:\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.cobblestonesoftware.com/contract-management-software/contract-workflows\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Intelligent workflows</a>, electronic approvals, and e-signatures\u00a0</strong>support on-time task completion and task escalations, timely reviews and approvals, and streamlined signing anywhere, anytime.\r\n<h2><strong>Challenge #4: Document storage, version control, and redlining</strong></h2>\r\n<strong>Remedy #4: A secure, cloud-based repository with unlimited storage</strong>\u00a0ensures you have access to the most up-to-date version of contracts, documents, and agreements.\u00a0 You\u2019ll also have access to version history for faster negotiations and streamlined redlining with an MS Word integration.\u00a0 The repository makes contract language analysis for compliance easy and will allow legal teams to ensure they are viewing every active contract so language and templates can quickly be updated in response to new regulations.\r\n<h2><strong>Challenge #5: Risk Assessment</strong></h2>\r\n<strong>Remedy #5:</strong>\u00a0<strong>Contract artificial intelligence with machine learning\u00a0</strong>analyzes contract language when new contracts are added and screens old contracts for sensitive data and red flags.\u00a0 As contract volume, complexity, and risk increases, proactive\u00a0<strong><a href=\"https://www.cobblestonesoftware.com/blog/assessing-contract-risk-early-identification-and-prevention\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">risk assessments</a></strong>\u00a0prepare General Counsel for contract performance reviews, renewals, and negotiations.\r\n<h2><strong>Challenge #6: Security</strong></h2>\r\n<strong>Remedy #6</strong>:\u00a0<strong>Leading\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.cobblestonesoftware.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">contract management software</a></strong>\u00a0helps monitor milestones, penalties, discounts, business terms, and more.\u00a0 Consistent monitoring and protection keep contracts GDPR compliant.\u00a0 General Counsel is expected to collaborate with IT to ensure the security of corporate and client data and to have a process in place to address data breaches.\u00a0 Configurable rules-based user permissions ensure only the right people have access to documents within secured contract storage that is accessible across different devices.\r\n<h2><strong>Challenge #7: Visibility and reporting</strong></h2>\r\n<strong>Remedy #7:</strong>\u00a0<strong>Contract searching and reporting\u00a0</strong>allows legal teams to find the correct versions of documents and see where they are in the contract process.\u00a0 Intelligent, automated workflows create recurring contract reports and actionable recommendations based on real-time\u00a0<strong><a href=\"https://www.cobblestonesoftware.com/blog/5-critical-decisions-driven-by-contract-data\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">contract data</a></strong>.\u00a0 More contract visibility helps General Counsel quickly analyze data to answer the C-Suite's strategic questions.\r\n<h2><strong>Contract Management Adjourned</strong></h2>\r\nCobbleStone Software helps General Counsel and legal teams bring more value to their organizations while reducing the costs associated with contract creation, review, and\u00a0<strong><a href=\"https://www.cobblestonesoftware.com/blog/contract-lifecycle-management-part-1-mastering-contract-management-series\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">contract lifecycle management</a></strong>.\r\n\r\nWith enterprise-wide capabilities, a user-friendly platform, fast implementation, and clear ROI within as little as 30 days, our legal contract management solution

Balfour Beatty selected Reveal\u2019s eDiscovery solution because it allows for the self-performance of eDiscovery processing, data analytics, utilization of sophisticated artificial intelligence models for technology-assisted review and a consolidated document review platform that can be used across their U.S. business.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen starting this process, I knew we needed a platform that was cloud-based and easily scalable. We sought to find the right balance of ease of use while having access to intuitive yet robust artificial intelligence and visualization tools,\u201d says Aaron Bath, CED, RP, and national director of litigation management at Balfour Beatty. \u201cReveal\u2019s platform has the flexibility to interact with our data in a manner we are accustomed to while harnessing the platform\u2019s muscle to improve our efficiency, lower our costs and better leverage our documents. Reveal\u2019s consulting expertise and training team developed a bespoke workflow addressing the unique needs and challenges of the construction / infrastructure space.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cReveal is uniquely positioned to fulfill Balfour Beatty\u2019s eDiscovery needs. The company needed an eDiscovery solution that conforms to the many different requirements of discovery,\u201d says Wendell Jisa, chief executive officer for Reveal. \u201cReveal allows for companies like Balfour Beatty to adapt as their discovery needs shift with every case, because of our 19 data centers, support and highly scalable, cloud-based eDiscovery and investigation solution.\u201d\r\n\r\nReveal recently announced the <a href=\"https://www.revealdata.com/reveal-version-8/\">launch of the latest version of the platform</a>, which contains 210 new features that provide more speed and scalability for eDiscovery. The new enhancements continue the company\u2019s efforts to help law firms and corporate legal departments navigate regulations, accelerate review and conquer big data with data centers across five continents.

    "short_description": "Reveal Releases 210 New Features That Provide More Speed and Scalability for Global eDiscovery",
    "social_media_description": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Reveal, the leading provider of eDiscovery and investigation software and services tailored for global use, today announced that it has introduced new updates that will allow law firms and corporate legal departments to conduct review even more quickly and reliably.\u00a0</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201ceDiscovery is now a global endeavor, as businesses of all sizes expand across borders. The lawyers that represent those businesses face amplified complications related to global eDiscovery, such as building infrastructures, scaling quickly, navigating strict data regulations from country to country and controlling the high costs of discovery overseas. Reveal helps lawyers address all of these challenges. These new features, in particular, will allow lawyers to complete eDiscovery more quickly and efficiently,\u201d said Wendell Jisa, chief executive officer for Reveal.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The new features include:\u00a0</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A self-service portal enabling legal professionals to upload large and complex data sets via the web interface which are then automatically processed, all without the need for vendor assistance like most other eDiscovery platforms. When the processing is complete, the user can customize their workflow by either loading the data for review or performing early case assessment automatically \u2013 increasing the speed to discovery.\u00a0</span></li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Optimizations to how Reveal manages and schedules index, imaging and production tasks that allow clients to begin and complete review faster.\u00a0</span></li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Enhanced cloud-based scalability that keeps clients at maximum productivity. As processing requests increase, Reveal will automatically increase infrastructure capacity, ensuring legal professionals can focus on the case, not the hardware required to support eDiscovery.</span></li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A new, preconfigured standard project template that starts out ready to use with time-tested defaults, eliminating the hours customarily required for setup by a consultant, paralegal or eDiscovery expert. This includes the most commonly used tags, redaction profiles and field profiles \u2013 all ready for use. Clients also still have the flexibility to customize.\u00a0\u00a0</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Reveal issues continual updates for its technology throughout the year, balancing a client-driven methodology with the ability to identify and address evolving eDiscovery needs quickly.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The new enhancements continue the company\u2019s efforts to help law firms and corporate legal departments navigate regulations, accelerate review, and conquer big data on a global scale. Reveal recently added new data centers in Montreal and Tokyo, bringing the total to 19 centers across five continents and enabling customers to host data wherever needed. It also hired a new vice president of business development for Canada in October. Reveal, which specializes in international data privacy requirements, provides experienced consultants and support staff around the globe and offers a user interface that detects more than 160 languages.\u00a0</span>",

    "short_description": "Knowledge Management Will Be Seen as the Vital Function It Truly Is in 2021",
    "social_media_description": "Despite all the challenges of the past year \u2013 the COVID-19 pandemic chief among them \u2013 global banking and finance did not come to a grinding halt in 2020. Many finance professionals switched to remote working at the drop of a hat, and operations were largely unaffected.\r\n\r\n2021 looks to continue in a similar vein in the short to medium term. With people having undergone such a radical change of behaviour in 2020, it is the perfect time for everybody to embrace the opportunities presented by this for knowledge management (KM). As different approaches to KM consolidate, people are realising that KM and innovation are two sides of the same coin. At the same time, knowledge sharing is occurring less frequently in unstructured forums such as \u201cpopping your head around the door\u201d and structured processes are now emerging. This is a very exciting time for KM.\r\n\r\n<strong>The Methods Have Merged</strong>\r\n\r\nUntil recently, two distinct approaches to KM have been taken. European businesses, for example, have long relied on creating content and knowhow, while the US has tended to favour technology, search, and data.\r\n\r\nThese approaches are now starting to come together. The content creators are realising the importance of capturing structured data to inform their content. The data curators are realising the importance of feeding their data into a tangible end-product. By combining the two distinct approaches, business have made the first important step towards the next generation of KM.\r\n\r\nThose who consume knowledge are ready for these two approaches to merge. A decade ago, many working in banking and finance took pride in saying \u201cevery transaction is different\u201d. Now, thanks to the business imperative to reduce the time and cost of transacting, there appears to be recognition that even the most complex banking and finance projects have repeatable elements.\r\n\r\nBy being rigorous around capturing past experiences, creating taxonomies, and establishing a knowledge curation process, businesses can start to leverage their data to improve their knowledge content \u2013 and ultimately, their service delivery. Deals are no longer created from scratch; there is always a starting point, no matter how complex a deal appears to be.\r\n\r\n<strong>Is KM the New Innovation?</strong>\r\n\r\nTechnology and innovation have very much been seen as \u201cgame changers\u201d in the banking and finance world. In contrast, people who leave client-facing roles (such as being a practicing lawyer) to take up KM positions have been seen as \u201ctaking a step down\u201d. Given the opportunities KM presents for businesses \u2013 particularly by coupling data with content \u2013 this is starting to change.\r\n\r\nThere is a growing recognition that innovation doesn\u2019t happen in isolation. It requires an in-depth understanding of internal processes, and KM is ideally positioned to provide this in-depth understanding.\r\n\r\nBusinesses have rightly asked themselves, \u201cif modern KM is about process, content, and data, what exactly\u00a0<em>is</em>\u00a0the role of innovation?\u201d After all, even the most talked about technologies do not happen in isolation. They must affect a\u00a0<em>process</em>\u00a0and drive an\u00a0<em>outcome</em>, both of which are within the domain of KM. In short, KM\u00a0<em>is</em>\u00a0innovation, and the two should no longer be considered as discrete areas of expertise.\r\n\r\n<strong>\u201cNo Office\u201d Shouldn\u2019t Mean \u201cNo Knowledge Sharing\u201d</strong>\r\n\r\nMore than any other factor, the importance of KM has been brought into the spotlight by the wholescale changes in working practices observed over the last 12 months.\r\n\r\nSuccessful knowledge management systems rely on data being captured, structuring that data, and fitting it into a taxonomy that enables people to find it. Since time immemorial, the primary method of knowledge sharing has been \u201chaving a chat with somebody\u201d, or \u201cpopping your head around somebody\u2019s door\u201d. Those kinds of information sharing are unstructured, bilateral, and not conducive to a KM process that prioritises capture and re-use of information.\r\n\r\nRemote work has caused people to interact differently. People are communicating in structured forums such as messaging platforms. This presents an opportunity for \u201cinformation sharers\u201d to be directed to a specific place to ask their questions and obtain answers (e.g., a \u201cknowledge channel\u201d in Slack or Teams). By structuring the process through which people seek and obtain knowledge, KM teams can tap into a wealth of information that previously laid to rest in office corridors.\r\n\r\nWhat 2021 has in store has yet to be seen, but one thing is certain: KM has an important role to play in the coming year, and increasingly, it will be seen as the vital function it truly is, helping financial services organisations to efficiently tackle the challenges they face.",

    "social_media_description": "<h1><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">LawPay is essential to the Smith &amp; Vinson Law Firm</span></h1>\r\n<b>BACKGROUND</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Smith &amp; Vinson Law Firm is a criminal defense firm founded in Austin, Texas in 2016. They are 100 percent focused on criminal defense, representing individuals in cases involving DWI, domestic violence, assault, sex crimes, weapons charges, and other criminal justice matters. \u201cOur mission is to do everything possible to help the client out,\u201d said Brad Vinson, one of the founding partners at Smith &amp; Vinson. \u201cWe want you to know that we\u2019re here to fight for you, no matter what.\u201d</span>\r\n\r\n<b>ONLINE PAYMENTS FROM DAY ONE</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Smith &amp; Vinson knew from the very beginning that they wanted to accept online payments in their firm. For Jarrod Smith, founding partner at Smith &amp; Vinson, LawPay was his first choice. \u201cWe actually started with LawPay. It was recommended by our state bar, and by other lawyers, as the best payment processor.\u201d Brad Vinson did some research on online payment processors, but after reviewing several options that were available, the answer was clear. \u201cWe talked to our bank and a couple other banks about the services they offered. No one really compared to what LawPay was putting on the table.\u201d</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">While the firm still accepts other forms of payments, LawPay\u2019s online payments solution quickly became their clients\u2019 preferred way to pay. Brad Vinson said that \u201cprobably 80 percent of the transactions that clients make with us come from LawPay.\u201d Jarrod Smith concurred, \u201c</span><b>our clients love LawPay!</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201d</span>\r\n\r\n<b>PAYMENT FLEXIBILITY\u00a0</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Smith &amp; Vinson appreciated how LawPay allowed them to get a payment request out the door as soon as one came up. \u201cIn criminal defense, clients often want to pay you outside of their payment schedule,\u201d said Brad Vinson. \u201cWe have requests at any given moment for a payment, and we want to be able to send one right away.\u201d\u00a0</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Jarrod Smith particularly liked how LawPay\u2019s Quick Bill feature streamlined Smith &amp; Vinson\u2019s practice. \u201cQuick Bill has been essential. </span><b>It has made our practice more efficient, and it saves us time and money </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">by being able to send out payments so quickly.\u201d</span>\r\n\r\n<b>KEEPING TRACK OF PAYMENTS</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Another standout LawPay feature for Smith &amp; Vinson is its robust reporting system. \u201cBeing able to quickly go in and see on a month-to-month basis how much money is coming in through LawPay is something we really like,\u201d said Brad Vinson. \u201cAlso, being able to see more specific criteria, like picking a date range and seeing how much income had come in during that time period. We really like it.\u201d Jarrod Smith echoed his partner\u2019s praise of LawPay\u2019s reporting features. \u201cThey allow me and my legal assistant to quickly see who has paid and who hasn\u2019t.\u201d In all, Smith &amp; Vinson feel they couldn\u2019t have made a better choice by going with LawPay. As Brad Vinson put it, \u201cbetween the speed of doing a transaction, the fees associated with them, the ease of use\u2014we felt comfortable that LawPay was the way to go.\u201d</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

Kim Wilson happily recounted, </span><b>\u201cincorporating LawPay into our practice was the easiest technology addition we have ever made!\u201d\u00a0</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Prior to LawPay, Fraser, Wilson &amp; Bryan was using a payment solution that just wasn\u2019t meeting their specific needs as a law firm. \u201cWhen it comes to accepting credit card payments, they can\u2019t be co-mingled with the charges coming from credit card services.\u201d Thankfully, LawPay was built specifically to address this issue for law firms. \u201cLawPay is able to make us ethically compliant in a very easy way. If you\u2019re going to use a credit card system, </span><b>you should be using a system that understands the business of law\u2014and that\u2019s LawPay</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.\u201d</span>\r\n\r\n<b>IMPROVING THEIR PRACTICE</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Kim Wilson found that LawPay has made her firm\u2019s daily operations simpler and more efficient. Their clients are able to pay much faster than if they used traditional methods. \u201cPaying through LawPay is convenient for our clients. They don\u2019t have to wait until we\u2019re open, or stop by the office. They just go online and make their payment.\u201d\u00a0</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Since making the switch, more and more of Fraser, Wilson &amp; Bryan\u2019s clients have been making payments through LawPay. \u201cAbout 40 percent of our payments are done online or over the phone through LawPay,\u201d Kim Wilson noted. In fact, using LawPay has helped lead to increased profits for Fraser, Wilson, &amp; Bryan. \u201c</span><b>We\u2019ve had a 10 percent swing in our profit margin</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">,\u201d said Kim Wilson. \u201cAbout 6 percent is attributable to more revenue and about 4 percent attributing to doing less work.\u201d</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">LawPay\u2019s location-flexibility is also valuable to Fraser, Wilson, &amp; Bryan. When Kim Wilson travels for mediation services, she is able to take payments for her services right then and there, which has made the other lawyers turn their heads. \u201cIt always impresses the other lawyers that I\u2019m able to take payments no matter where I am,\u201d Kim Wilson said.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">All in all, Fraser, Wilson, &amp; Bryan couldn\u2019t be happier that they discovered LawPay so many years ago. As Kim Wilson describes it,</span><b> \u201cLawPay helps us deliver customer service that exceeds their expectations. That\u2019s what I need from legal technology\u2014to make me look like a rockstar and a modern law firm. LawPay does that.\u201d</b>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

    "short_description": "3 Ways Law Departments Can Improve Business Processes with Document Management Systems",
    "social_media_description": "According to the \u201c12<sup>th</sup>\u00a0Annual Law Department Operations Survey,\u201d released last month, business process improvement is the leading current and expected challenge for corporate legal departments, followed closely by the need to stay abreast of law department technology.\r\n\r\nThe survey produced by the\u00a0<a href=\"https://blicksteingroup.com/\">Blickstein Group</a>\u00a0is created via an advisory board consisting of law department operations professionals from Fortune 500 companies and other consultants.\r\n\r\nThe good news from the report is that more corporate legal professionals (70.2%) are reporting that they have the right technology to do their jobs than in the previous survey (68.6%). And more specifically, 57.4% said they had plans to update, evaluate, or implement a document management system (DMS) in the next 12 months to extend that upswing.\r\n\r\nHowever, on a scale of 1 to 10, respondents ranked the effectiveness of DMS technology in general at a 6.7\u2014well behind the 7.1 average score for all legal information technologies. While up from a 5.9 in the previous year\u2019s survey, the 2019 report lists a few reasons for this perceived lack of effectiveness, notedly insufficient training, poor implementation, and underuse.\r\n\r\nHere are 3 ways law departments can overcome these and other challenges with DMS and improve their business processes:\r\n\r\n<strong>Enable better search in a DMS</strong>\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s clear from the low effectiveness scores for DMS technology that traditional products aren\u2019t meeting the needs of contemporary legal departments. One way that this can be improved is to enable better search in your DMS.\r\n\r\nUsers need to more effectively save and search a large volume of documents, emails, and messages that flow through the legal department.\u00a0<a href=\"https://imanage.com/work10/\">Modern DM</a>S offers suggested filing locations and personalized search that delivers more accurate results by remembering what you search for most often.\r\n\r\nWhile 47.4% of survey respondents indicated they don\u2019t use\u00a0<a href=\"https://imanage.com/product/ravn/\">Artificial Intelligence in their legal departments</a>, this technology is ripe for improving DMS effectiveness. By enabling improved user document search and even extraction of specific datasets buried in documents with AI, legal departments can significantly improve their business processes. Nearly 27% of survey respondents indicated they\u2019re using AI for e-discovery or document review, while 13% indicated they\u2019re using it for insight or predictions.\r\n\r\n<strong>Offer a better DMS experience to users and the organization</strong>\r\n\r\nAs suggested in the survey, DMS effectiveness often is hindered by underuse. One strategy to overcome this challenge is to offer legal departments a more consumer-like experience with these technologies. Modern DMS empowers professionals to work more productively while enabling legal departments to be more efficient, agile, and responsive to the changing business environment.\r\n\r\nIt does so by mirroring consumer applications like Amazon and Google, with intuitive features that work the way users want to work on any device, while requiring minimal training. It anticipates user actions, and integrates with other tools that legal professionals use, such as matter management, conflict management, and workflow software.\r\n\r\nFurther, a modern DMS offers benefits at the organization level, with cloud delivery models to enhance organizational agility with rapid deployment, automated updates, and the flexibility to add new functionality as needed.\r\n\r\n<strong>Offer comprehensive security in a DMS</strong>\r\n\r\nLegal organizations have unique requirements for securing documents for all their different clients. This only becomes more complex when they must also meet the various legal requirements for all the countries in which they do business. So, it\u2019s no surprise that handling global issues ranked 6th in top challenges legal departments face according to the survey, while compliance issues and data protection came in 9<sup>th</sup>.\r\n\r\nModern DMS delivers\u00a0<a href=\"https://imanage.com/product/security-risk-governance/\">comprehensive security</a>, built on established industry best practices, to protect information assets. These protections are augmented by comprehensive governance, security, and risk mitigation features including need-to-know security and ethical walls, to govern information access.\r\n\r\nLearn more about how a modern DMS can help your legal department improve its business processes\u00a0<a href=\"https://netrightllc-my.sharepoint.com/personal/beckie_schuerenberg_imanage_com/Documents/imanage.com\">here</a>.",

    "social_media_description": "<h1>Adoption of Casepoint eDiscovery Continues to Grow at Record Rates</h1>\r\n<p class=\"subtitle\">Customer adoption of Casepoint eDiscovery platform exceeds all forecasts; number of matters running on the platform is up 453% from previous year.</p>\r\nTYSONS, Va.,\u00a0<span class=\"xn-chron\">Feb. 4, 2020</span>\u00a0--\u00a0Casepoint, a leader in enterprise eDiscovery technology, today announced a series of dramatic growth indicators from 2019 that position the company for further success in 2020. Last year marked the release of a transformative upgrade to Casepoint eDiscovery running on Casepoint Platform. The ensuing growth includes the addition of a number of major clients, a more than quadruple increase in the number of matters running on the company's eDiscovery platform, and a massive expansion of its employee base.\r\n\r\nAmong the client wins are Vandeventer Black LLP, Larkin Hoffman Attorneys,\u00a0<span class=\"xn-person\">Spilman Thomas</span>\u00a0&amp; Battle, and Ryley Carlock &amp; Applewhite. \"Casepoint has been a valuable and cost-efficient eDiscovery resource tool for both our attorneys and our clients. The all-inclusive TAR/analytics/AI features, self-service options, user-friendly interface, and experienced project management support are key. In addition, the transparent and competitive pricing model helps us with cost predictability and cost containment for our clients,\" said Phi Tran, Esq., Director of eDiscovery at Ryley Carlock &amp; Applewhite. Also in 2019, Casepoint was\u00a0<u><a href=\"https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2710172-1&amp;h=504126059&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.casepoint.com%2Fpress%2Fus-securities-exchange-commission-sec-selects-casepoint%2F%3Futm_source%3Dprnewswire%26utm_medium%3Dpress-release%26utm_campaign%3Dlegalweek2020%26utm_content%3Dpr-1-29-20&amp;a=selected\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">selected</a></u>\u00a0in October by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to conduct a cloud-based eDiscovery pilot after undergoing a rigorous multi-step evaluation process. Several of the new clients have elected to standardize on Casepoint eDiscovery across the entire enterprise, which has allowed them to replace multiple tools from other vendors and/or internal tools with Casepoint's integrated solution.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as we released a transformative upgrade of Casepoint eDiscovery last year, we experienced accelerated growth and quickly began hiring, with a particular focus on the product team,\" said\u00a0<span class=\"xn-person\">David Carns</span>, Chief Revenue Officer at Casepoint. \"Since then we have added multiple new features and enhancements to the platform, and plan to make additional improvements in the next few months. We are now well-positioned to respond to the rapidly increasing demand for our products and services in the year to come.\"\r\n\r\nAt the end of 2019, the number of legal matters running on Casepoint had increased by 453% over 2018. To accommodate this dramatic increase in its business and prepare for additional growth in 2020, Casepoint has been busy expanding its workforce. The company now has a total of 550 employees, up from 370 in\u00a0<span class=\"xn-chron\">July 2019</span>\u00a0and 45 in 2015. The product team count currently stands at 320, up from 175 in July and 15 in 2015. The focus on expanding the product team reflects Casepoint's ongoing commitment to continual improvement and rapid responsiveness to client feedback and requests.\r\n\r\n\"The new numbers and client wins suggest that Casepoint eDiscovery running on Casepoint Platform is quickly becoming the industry standard,\" said\u00a0<span class=\"xn-person\">Haresh Bhungalia</span>, Chief Executive Officer at Casepoint. \"Many of our customers have switched to Casepoint from Relativity, Recommind, Case Logistix, Ipro Eclipse, Nuix, or other platforms. They made the switch to Casepoint after experiencing our platform's industry-leading speed, its unprecedented flexibility, and extensibility, the power of fully integrated AI and the ease of managing the entire eDiscovery process within a single, user-friendly interface.\"\r\n\r\nNow in its twelfth year, Casepoint offers blazing-fast, enterprise-class tools for full-spectrum eDiscovery, including cloud collections, data processing, advanced analytics, artificial intelligence, full-strength review, and customizable productions.

The solution\u2019s new save and anonymize workflow allows lawyers to reuse content from their prior work to safely create new documents faster.\r\n\r\n\"Clause Companion is a necessity at our firm,\u201d a CIO with a Global 100 firm said. \u201cIt is easy, fast, and changes the game for lawyers. Not only does it empower them to provide practical guidance on how to use preferred phrases and content, but the new \"Anonymize\" function provides a flexible solution for document creation. Now, all lawyers -- not just transactional folks -- can save, reuse, and leverage their best content without needing to be a document expert or interrupting their workflow.\u201d\r\n\r\nClause Companion\u2019s Anonymize feature offers users several benefits:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Automatically anonymizes content by detecting and replacing deal-specific data with the choice of blanks, symbols, or variables</li>\r\n \t<li>Anonymized documents can be saved to the Clause Companion library as easily accessible, ready-to-go templates</li>\r\n \t<li>Allows lawyers to safely reuse these documents and their preferred content faster, without ever leaving Microsoft Word</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\u201cLawyers often use the fastest process to draft high-quality documents \u2013 by starting from an existing document that they\u2019re familiar with,\u201d Avaneesh Marwaha, CEO of Litera, said. \u201cSorting through content libraries to identify the best, most current documents and replacing the critical details in them takes substantial time that could be better spent on higher-value tasks. Anonymize helps lawyers by making this process smarter, faster, and more secure.\u201d\r\n\r\nLearn more by watching our <a href=\"https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/NW3oCrk66VuKEQt7f2Ek?domain=youtube.com\">video on Clause Companion</a>.\r\n\r\n<strong>About Litera</strong>\r\nLitera is the leading provider of software for managing transactions and drafting, proofreading, comparing, repairing, cleaning, and securing documents in legal and corporate industries worldwide.

    "short_description": "The ROI of AI: Take your legal practice to the next level",
    "social_media_description": "<a href=\"https://www.luminance.com/contact.html\">More than 80% of lawyers</a>\u00a0now view technology adoption as essential for the future of their firm and three quarters view the future adoption of AI specifically as key. Yet in increasingly uncertain economic times, the return on investment or \u2018ROI\u2019 of any outlay an organisation makes is going to be highly scrutinised. Crucially, lawyers need technologies that they can trust to get the results they need, not only to maintain business stability but also to take their work to the next level.\r\n\r\n<strong>Take on more projects with Luminance</strong>\r\n\r\nThe legal and business marketplace is becoming increasingly competitive: law firms and in-house legal departments are tightening their belts to maintain profitability while clients are demanding increased expertise, efficiency and transparency from their lawyers.\r\n\r\nLuminance brings machine learning to the legal profession, uniquely combining supervised and unsupervised machine learning to read and form an understanding of data, instantly surfacing crucial information such as clauses and datapoints. By reducing the amount of time and legal professionals needed to find the key data within documents, lawyers can choose to spend more time on higher-value analysis work, or can instead redirect resource to undertake additional projects.\r\n\r\nFor example, Luminance customer, Burness Paull, is using the Luminance \u2018Discovery\u2019 platform to conduct DSARs (Data Subject Access Requests) arising from data protection regulations like the GDPR. Without Luminance, the resource needed to fully comply with each DSAR means that the service is often not economically viable for lawyers to offer their clients or, in the case of in-house teams, without the support of external counsel. Yet with the assistance of Luminance\u2019s technology, firms can dramatically reduce the time spend on each review. For instance, the first time that Burness Paull used Luminance to conduct a DSAR of 6,000 documents they saw 50% time savings, thus ensuring profitability when offering this service to their clients.\r\n\r\n<strong>Meeting the spectrum of client demands</strong>\r\n\r\nNot only can Luminance help lawyers to attract new business, but it can help provide an enhanced service to existing clients, too. By using flexible machine learning technology, Luminance can be used across a wide range of projects, enabling them to proactively respond to new challenges and in turn, expand their client service offering. For example, \u2018Big Four\u2019 accounting firm, Ernst &amp; Young (EY) Law Belgium are using Luminance\u2019s flexible technology to help their clients with Brexit compliance and now LIBOR transition projects. As St\u00e9phanie De Smet, a Corporate Lawyer at EY Law Belgium, put it,\u00a0<em>\u201cWith many of our clients concerned about the impact and cost of a LIBOR review, Luminance\u2019s powerful machine learning is fundamental to our legal practice.\u201d</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Flexible pricing for lawyer and client</strong>\r\n\r\nLuminance has a range of commercial models from pay-as-you-go model to subscriptions options for larger data usage. This ensures that the platform can benefit firms and organisations of every size, from boutique law firms right through to the Big Four. Further, Luminance requires little-to-no set-up time before use, with most customers up and running within a matter of hours. Indeed, with Luminance\u2019s intuitive and easy-to-use system, no bespoke user training is required and legal teams can see real results from day one.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to recouping their initial outlay on technology spend, some law firms choose to pass on the cost of their investment directly to their clients as a technology fee. Other firms choose to pass on some of the cost savings to their clients, offering competitive pricing in order to win additional business: one \u2018Global Top 100\u2019 law firm recently used Luminance to conduct a review of employment contracts and were able to save their client $800,000, representing an impressive 90% cost saving. And other firms might choose to maintain the same fees, keeping lawyers working the same hours on the project but with more time spent on analysis rather than sifting through the data. The range of ways firms might maximise the value of their technological investment is covered in our white paper.\r\n\r\n<strong>Try Luminance for free today</strong>\r\n\r\nLegal professionals are at a pivotal point- with advanced technology available and more accessible than ever, lawyers have tools at their fingertips that will allow them to do more with less resources, keep up with the accelerating pace of their business and use time more effectively. Luminance offers a two-week free pilot today so users can the the transformative potential of Luminance\u2019s technology at work in their organisation.\r\n\r\n<em>For more information, please read the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.luminance.com/files/white_papers/building_a_business_case_for_ai.pdf\">Luminance Business Case White Paper</a>\u00a0or contact\u00a0info@luminance.com.</em>",

    "short_description": "AI will propel the legal industry to new frontiers in 2021",
    "social_media_description": "It is safe to say that 2020 was a challenging and unprecedented year across all industries, not least the legal sector. Yet our altered ways of working have spawned new innovations and different ways of thinking about \u201cbusiness as usual.\u201d For the legal sector, AI has become a key part of many lawyers\u2019 arsenal, allowing them to rapidly respond to new challenges such as remote working, increased market and economic volatility and complex client demands. As we approach 2021, it is clear that this momentum in the legal sector to embrace all things tech shows no sign of stopping anytime soon.\r\n\r\n<strong>\u2018Technophobia\u2019 is no longer a viable excuse for lawyers</strong>\r\n\r\nThe pandemic has accelerated the pace of technology adoption generally, and has also opened lawyers\u2019 eyes to the possibilities that advanced technology such as AI can herald. Technology has moved from being a \u2018nice to have\u2019 to a \u2018must have\u2019, allowing businesses and lawyers to keep pace with marketplace changes whilst also driving profitability and growth.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s take the example of M&amp;A due diligence- whilst years ago, the number of contracts to review for a transaction was a lengthy yet reasonable task, an explosion in enterprise data has rendered this process practically unfeasible. Indeed, hiring armies of junior lawyers to manually trawl through endless volumes of contracts in order to find a crucial \u2018Change of Control\u2019 clause is increasingly becoming recognised as a waste of resources and an inefficient use of legal talent.\r\n\r\nAnd this is where AI comes in: Luminance is able to rapidly read and form an understanding of legal data, instantly surfacing crucial clauses, datapoints and anomalies at the click of a button. Not only does this instil lawyers with the greatest confidence that nothing has been missed in their review, but by enabling them to cut through the admin-heavy, mundane work, advisors are once again able to focus on adding value where it matters: the analysis. As Gavin Williams, Partner at Holland &amp; Knight said to me at a recent Luminance webinar,\u00a0<em>\u201cLuminance allows young lawyers to push skills faster, resulting in better quality and better work product which is closer to being \u2018client ready\u2019 than ever before.\u201d</em>\r\n\r\nAnother example is the sudden switch to remote working in 2020. With many offices now remote working for the foreseeable future and some organisations reimagining how offices will function after that, it seems that increased remote working or flexi-working is here to stay. Luminance\u2019s easy cloud-deployment and advanced collaboration tools such as the ability to allocate tasks and track work progression are invaluable for the seamless coordination of legal teams. We have had customers such as VdA, Norburg &amp; Scherp and The 36 Group use the tool to coordinate teams in connection with large review projects.\r\n\r\nClearly, the real, practical value of AI can no longer be overlooked and as we enter 2021, it is clear that AI is integral to the infrastructure of all organisations.\r\n\r\n<strong>Clients expect more- tech is part of the answer</strong>\r\n\r\nClient demands and expectations have always been high on the agenda for law firms yet increased economic volatility and steepening competition will once again push these demands into the spotlight in 2021. Indeed, recent research by Luminance found that decreased client budgets are the biggest concern for senior lawyers. Clients are increasingly savvy as to the technology that is available to lawyers as well as the benefits in terms of efficiency, insight and cost.\r\n\r\nThis year, for example, the Dubai office of Dentons were tasked with a time-sensitive review of 200 documents. This number quickly swelled to over 180,000 documents, all of which had to be reviewed in just two weeks. After consulting with their client, Dentons opted to deploy Luminance and were able to review the entire dataset within the timeline set by the client and with huge cost-savings. Results like this show that by embracing technology, lawyers are able to not just meet but exceed the expectations of their clients and this is something that we predict will continue far into 2021.\r\n\r\n<strong>The year that in-house teams embrace technology</strong>\r\n\r\nThe last few years have seen a growth in the role and scope of in-house legal professionals. Indeed, in-house lawyers are not just subject matter specialists that are only to be consulted on specific legal matters but are instead now expected to play a significant and proactive role in wider legal matters, including ensuring compliance, examining potential business risk and being key members of the corporate decision-making team.\r\n\r\nConsistent with this trend, this year there has been a 65% increase in the uptake of our technology by in-house teams in order to streamline work such as the review of outside counsel guidelines, employment contracts and regulatory compliance reviews in the face of data protection regulations such as the GDPR and CCPA. We expect to see a continued acceleration in this trend in 2021, with these lawyers becoming more tech-savvy, efficient and sophisticated in the projects they manage in-house in order to better control costs during uncertain economic times. Recently, we welcomed Featurespace, a market-leader in enterprise financial crime prevention software, as a customer in order to help the company\u2019s in-house legal team to gain more control over their in-house processes.\r\n\r\n<strong>2021: The year that AI got real in the legal industry?</strong>\r\n\r\nThis year has marked a turning point for the legal industry\u2019s adoption of AI technology. At Luminance, we have seen an astonishing 40% increase in the uptake of our technology since the beginning of the year, with Luminance\u2019s customer base now reaching nearly 300 firms and organisations. In 2021, AI will be a fundamental component of every law firm and business and to that end, the future of the industry.",

    "social_media_description": "<a href=\"https://imanage.com/\">iManage</a>, the company dedicated to transforming how professionals work, today announced that\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.walderwyss.com/en\">Walder Wyss Ltd.</a>\u00a0\u2013 one of the most successful and fastest growing Swiss commercial law firms \u2013 is using\u00a0<a href=\"https://imanage.com/solution/knowledge-unlocked/\">iManage Knowledge Unlocked, powered by RAVN,</a>\u00a0to transform their approach to knowledge management.\r\n\r\niManage Knowledge Unlocked puts knowledge in the hands of the users with 7 ways to search across\u00a0<a href=\"https://imanage.com/product/imanage-work/\">iManage Work</a>\u00a0and other systems. It helps users discover new content\u00a0and insights, identify similar matters or motions, highlight relevant content, and\u00a0provide updated intelligence on legal principles while respecting security and\u00a0confidentiality that is so important to the industry. When integrated with powerful business intelligence tools like Microsoft Power BI, it provides Knowledge teams with powerful analytics that enable content to be kept relevant, fresh and additional resources added that meet the needs of the users.\r\n\r\nWalder Wyss can instantly see data around which members of the firm are actively using the knowledge management system, what type of searches users are carrying out, what type of results are being returned, and where there might be gaps in content or other areas that require attention to optimize knowledge flow. This enables the firm\u2019s knowledge management team to make statistical connections between users and data.\r\n\r\nIdentifying \u201cpower users\u201d assists in the effort to expand usage across the organization, to uncover and replicate best-practices, and to create best practice document templates. Data regarding what documents and knowledge are\u00a0<em>not</em>\u00a0being accessed also provides deep and valuable insights for improvements of how documents can be refined to better meet the expectations and needs of the firm\u2019s lawyers.\r\n\r\nRather than relying on anecdotal evidence about what knowledge assets its professionals find most valuable, the knowledge management team at Walder Wyss is now able to use data to determine how people are\u00a0using\u00a0the system. This supports an ongoing process of quality improvement to guide the investment in the knowledge content, enabling the team to make better decisions and deliver higher quality service, driving competitive advantage for the firm.\r\n\r\n\u201cLawyers are busy people \u2013 most of them don\u2019t have time to tell us how they\u2019ve been using the knowledge management system,\u201d said Urs Bracher, Legal Engineer and Head of KM at Walder Wyss. \u201cHaving Knowledge Unlocked means that we don't have to guess or rely on just a few lawyers telling us what type of knowledge management assets they find most useful, or where they need more help. We can look at the data and have insights into users\u2019 needs that allow us to better address their requirements.\u201d\r\n\r\n<strong>The Appeal of a Platform Approach</strong>\r\n\r\n\u201cWe were already using\u00a0<a href=\"https://imanage.com/product/imanage-work/\">iManage Work</a>\u00a0as our document management system, so it made a lot of sense to use Knowledge Unlocked for our knowledge management system,\u201d said Lorenz Reinle, Assistant Know-how and Legal Tech at Walder Wyss. \u201cIt was a natural extension of our usage of the iManage platform, and iManage is recognized as a leader in the international market, which helped simplify the decision.\u201d\r\n\r\nSince going live on Knowledge Unlocked earlier this year, Walder Wyss has rolled it out to all six of its offices in Switzerland. Eventually, there will be nearly 300 users who will use the iManage solution to search and access more than 7,000 knowledge assets within the knowledge management system, and several million documents within iManage Work.\r\n\r\n\u201cKnowledge is only as good as your users\u2019 ability to tap into it,\u201d Nick Thomson, General Manager, RAVN, iManage. \u201cWalder Wyss\u2019 usage of Knowledge Unlocked enables them to truly leverage their work product and enhance the effectiveness of their curated knowledge assets, allowing them to continually improve knowledge management processes and outcomes for their users.\u201d\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

This extracted information is then added to the metadata of the documents and is indexed along with the content to be searchable within the review platform. Users will be able to view, search for and automatically redact the names of people mentioned in documents, for example.\r\n\r\nMore importantly, this type of enrichment allows for smarter fact-finding within datasets, permitting the users to perform searches such as \u201cPERSON w/5 LOCATION\u201d where any person mentioned in any document within 5 words of any named location is revealed.\r\n\r\nZyLAB Insights will be available shortly to all ZyLAB ONE SaaS customers in both the North American and European markets and will be priced in bundles by the millions of characters indexed.\r\n\r\n<strong>About ZyLAB</strong>\r\nFounded in 1983, ZyLAB is a proven solution partner to legal professionals in corporations, law firms and governments worldwide.

    "social_media_description": "ne of the characteristics of the workplace of 2020 has been the lack of people in the office. COVID-19 saw a significant proportion of businesses adopt remote work in support of efforts to contain the pandemic.\r\n\r\nIs there a better way, a smart way for businesses to organise their workforce so that they can optimise fixed assets like facilities?\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.jll.com.hk/\"><strong>Jones Lang LaSalle</strong></a> (JLL) <a href=\"https://www.jll.com.hk/en/trends-and-insights/research/2021-asia-pacific-real-estate-outlook\"><strong>forecasts</strong></a> that \u201cupwards of 40% of today\u2019s office assets need some form of enhancement to stay relevant.\u201d The JLL report, Home and away: the new workplace hybrid?, suggests that during the COVID-19 period, 68% of employees were working from home.\r\n\r\nFutureCIO spoke to <strong><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dmalkani/\">Dinesh Malkani</a></strong>, founder and CEO of <strong><a href=\"https://smartenspaces.com/\">Smarten Spaces</a></strong>, how COVID-19 is forcing organisations to reimagine the workplace.\r\n\r\nSmarten Spaces has built technology and platform to make smarter and better use of workspaces. Malkani acknowledged that technology penetration in space management remains low although the pandemic may be changing that.\r\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\u201cEvery office is being re-done as people are moving towards the hybrid workplace. We happen to be a startup that has the entire technology solution ready to bring companies to hybrid working in the hybrid workplace.\"\r\n\r\n<cite>Dinesh Malkani</cite></blockquote>\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sundarnagarajan/\">Sundar Nagarajan</a></strong>, head of Consulting at JLL, noted that the pace of digitization and adoption of automation in 2020 has accelerated businesses to 2023-2024 levels right away, adjusting decision-making and way of working \u2013 all in the name of revenue.\r\n\r\nMalkani noted that the shift to a hybrid model of work is not entirely driven by COVID-19. Organisations have been studying this opportunity even before that. He did acknowledge that many such discussions floated around experimentations. He credits the pandemic as proving that it is possible to sanction work from anywhere without sacrificing productivity or risking security.\r\n\r\n\u201cCompanies have been moving in the direction of being able to work from anywhere \u2013 in the office, co-working space, or home, in what we now classify as hybrid work strategies,\u201d he concluded.\r\n<h4><strong>Challenges for leadership</strong></h4>\r\nAccording to Malkani, the challenge for CHROs is to ensure that they're able to offer the notion of flexibility to all of the workforce. \u201cThey will then need to consider the policies and rules around such arrangements. HR teams today are grappling with the fact that we can now hire anyone from anywhere in the world, as we work remotely,\u201d he added.\r\n\r\nFor CFOs and CEOs, the discussion will become mainly about cost considerations and the optimum use of whatever approach is taken by the company. The CIO\u2019s task will be around the use of technology to facilitate hybrid work strategies.\r\n<h4><strong>Technology-led adoption</strong></h4>\r\n\u201cTo create a frictionless environment where workforce productivity is at its peak, a lot of data needs to be relooked at. The CIO will need to ensure that the environment and network are secure and that regulations are complied with,\u201d he added.\r\n\r\nAccording to Malkani, the pandemic has influenced what and how technology is being used in the workplace. Employee safety and the ability to find available space have become important considerations in the adoption.\r\n\r\n\u201cIncorporating technology is key in making it easy and essential for the user to address their concerns, and that's when the adoption rate becomes high. Technology is no longer a nice to have. Beyond providing data, AI-incorporated technology that provides recommendations to business owners has a huge role to play in driving adoption rates,\u201d he added.\r\n\r\nHe saw the shift to AI within the realm of workspaces as an essential ingredient to achieving a successful hybrid workplace that is very productive and cost-effective.\r\n<h4>Click on the podchat player above to listen to Malkani share his opinion and recommendations on the better use of workspaces using technology.</h4>\r\n<ol type=\"1\">\r\n \t<li>How do you see space-as-a-service and office decentralization changing the workplace of the future?</li>\r\n \t<li>But how do you see space-as-a-service and office decentralisation changing the workplace of the future?</li>\r\n \t<li>Analysts suggest that the post-COVID workplace normalisation will combine remote work together with the traditional office environment.

    "social_media_description": "<h3>TAR Solutions for a New Decade</h3>\r\nThese days, it seems impossible to talk about eDiscovery or document review without mention of Technology Assisted Review (TAR). In its broadest use as a technical term, <em>TAR</em> can refer to virtually any manner of technical assistance \u2013 from password cracking to threading to duplicate and near-duplicate detection. In its narrower use, TAR refers to techniques that involve the use of technology to predict (or to replicate) the decision a human expert would make about the classification or category of a document. In this narrower sense, TAR often comes with a version number \u2013 <em>TAR 1.0, TAR 2.0, </em>and more recently, <em>TAR 3.0</em>. While some are inclined to advocate for the superiority of a single approach, each version has its merits and place, and understanding the underlying process and technology is crucial to selecting the right approach for a specific discovery need.\r\n\r\nWe recently authored a white paper to offer a discussion of the variables to consider when choosing the right TAR workflow for a specific matter, as well as the main principles behind different TAR solutions. By doing so, we make the claim that true preparedness lies in understanding the range of core technology within the TAR landscape, and further knowing how and where to access the right combination of people, process, and technology to meet any discovery need.\u00a0 If you or your team have had mixed results with TAR, or want some guidance on deciding your approach with TAR in your next matter, you may find this paper helpful.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://bit.ly/3osu32p\">TAR Solutions for a New Decade</a>",

    "social_media_description": "<em>ProSearch Privacy Suite combines deep learning models with human expertise to identify protected information</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>LOS ANGELES, Calif. \u2013 January 13, 2021 \u2013</strong> <a href=\"http://www.prosearch.com/\">ProSearch</a>, a leading provider of comprehensive discovery and compliance solutions to corporate legal departments and law firms, has unveiled its latest innovation for addressing modern privacy regulations as part of the company\u2019s holistic approach to discovery. ProSearch Privacy Suite uses deep learning models built on the latest advancements in natural language processing and computer vision techniques to identify protected private information, enabling organizations to better achieve compliance with ever-increasing privacy regulations.\r\n\r\nGovernments and regulatory agencies in the United States and around the world are enacting stricter regulations protecting individual data privacy. As organizations see increased enforcement of those regulations, they must be prepared to handle discovery data in an appropriate manner and understand the risk of not treating private data as they would privileged information.\r\n\r\nTo address these evolving needs, ProSearch has developed a robust solution for identifying PXI: the personally identifiable information (PII), protected health information (PHI), information subject to payment card industry data security standards (PCI-DSS) and other protected private, sensitive, or personal information.\r\n\r\nProSearch Privacy Suite enables a comprehensive approach that uses statistical models and linguistic features of natural language processing to move beyond simple search terms and regular expressions to identify private data. Privacy services at ProSearch combine the experience of data scientists, engineers, database analysts and discovery professionals to develop and deploy custom workflows to meet specific response requirements. The Privacy Suite combines classifiers based on deep learning techniques to identify private information in text with computer vision techniques to detect scans and facsimiles of documents that may contain protected information. Results are then integrated into custom Relativity review panels and dashboards to provide easy access to actionable metrics and to streamline review. Ongoing monitoring, maintenance and training of the deep learning models on the data enable customization and continuous incremental improvement.\r\n\r\n\u201cSupported by people, process and game-changing technology, the models and workflows of ProSearch Privacy Suite are customizable to a variety of needs related to identifying and protecting private information,\u201d says Julia Hasenzahl, ProSearch CEO. \u201cDetailed reporting about the volume and types of private information in enterprise data \u2013 at the matter level as well as across a portfolio \u2013 provides critical understanding of where protected information is generated and how it makes its way into review, supporting information governance and data retention planning to minimize future risk.\u201d\r\n\r\nProSearch reimagines the conventional approach to solution design and service delivery, helping clients take control of their discovery processes by staying focused on legal and strategic issues while reducing risk and costs. The company\u2019s Enterprise solution aligns ProSearch with clients in a way that traditional customer/vendor relationships cannot, with its team becoming an extension of the client\u2019s, listening and collaborating on solutions that maximize investments and improve outcomes.",

Required response times remain unchanged, though the volume of electronically stored information within the scope of a request can be extensive. Sufficient preparedness and reliable methods for narrowing large datasets down to specific, granular disclosures of a requestor\u2019s personal information can save organizations time and expense while keeping regulators at bay.\r\n\r\nA new ProSearch white paper offers practical tips to solve the employee DSAR challenge.\u00a0 Data collection, analytics, search optimization, and redaction tools\r\nfrequently handled by discovery teams can be hugely beneficial when applied to DSAR response. An experienced discovery team with a tried-and-tested solution\r\nfor DSARs can help manage the process: from filtering data collections down to the sample most likely containing information on the data subject to assisting in\r\nidentifying exemptions to tailoring disclosures to fit the request criteria of the data subject with exceptional precision.\r\n\r\nLearn how eDiscovery workflows you use today can be applied to employee DSAR response.\r\n\r\nDownload <a href=\"https://www.theedgeroom.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ProSearch-Practical-Insights-for-Responding-to-Employee-DSARS.pdf\">\"Practical Insights for Responding to Employee DSARs - A Primer.\u00a0</a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

    "social_media_description": "<a href=\"https://imanage.com/\">iManage</a>, the company dedicated to transforming how professionals work, today announced that <a href=\"https://www.bennettjones.com/\">Bennett Jones LLP</a> \u2013 a top Canadian law firm with more than 500 lawyers and 6 offices across Canada and the United States \u2013 has extended its deployment of <a href=\"https://imanage.com/product/imanage-work/\">iManage Work</a> by adopting <a href=\"https://imanage.com/solution/knowledge-unlocked/\">iManage Knowledge Unlocked</a>, an AI-based enterprise search solution which enables firms to gain more from knowledge management. Having deployed the solution to its legal professionals in June of 2020, the firm has established the foundation to leverage the transformative power of knowledge management across the firm, for the benefit of all their clients.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBennett Jones selected Knowledge Unlocked as a replacement for its previous enterprise search solution, which wasn\u2019t keeping pace with innovation. The firm was particularly drawn to the innovative and collaborative approach of the iManage team and the powerful indexing capabilities of the solution. The Knowledge Unlocked index powers the iManage knowledge graph, which enhances critical connections and builds relationships across its data to securely deliver search results with increased relevancy, contextual accuracy, and speed.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe Knowledge Unlocked solution has been branded internally by the firm as \u2018Insight Search\u2019. The solution enables Bennett Jones to surface key information from the firm\u2019s most valuable systems like their iManage document management system (DMS), knowledge bank, collection of closing books, and intranet, creating a more streamlined and effective user experience.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\u201cAt Bennett Jones, we\u2019re thinking long term,\u201d said Kate Simpson, National Director of Knowledge &amp; Practice Innovation at Bennett Jones. \u201cWe\u2019re asking: How do we create a tech stack that that allows Bennett Jones to be the best it can be, and to know what it knows? The iManage platform plays a prominent role in providing that foundation and Knowledge Unlocked only strengthens and expands what we\u2019re able to do. Knowledge Unlocked is the first step in an ongoing journey of how we connect and unlock insights across the organization; the opportunities are multifold.\u201d\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSince launching Insight Search to its legal professionals, Bennett Jones has continued to pilot new functionality from iManage that the firm will be able to take advantage of in coming quarters to deepen its ability to leverage organizational knowledge.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\u201cBennett Jones\u2019 usage of Knowledge Unlocked is fully keeping in spirit with its longstanding investment in knowledge management and technology infrastructure to promote collaboration, increase productivity, and drive efficiencies for its clients,\u201d said Alex Smith, Global Product Management Lead, iManage RAVN. \u201cWith Knowledge Unlocked, Bennett Jones can easily surface precedents, insights, and best practices that give clients access to the full depth of knowledge and expertise of the firm \u2013 delivering value to clients in new and efficient ways.\u201d",

    "social_media_description": "As the proponents of policy and creators of contracts, it\u2019s well understood that the legal department\u2019s job is, first and foremost, to manage risk. This involves identifying potential legal and regulatory issues as soon as possible, developing a profile of potential legal risks, avoiding those risks with compliance programs, and dealing with the ones that slip through the cracks.\r\n\r\nWhat is perhaps less well understood is how dramatically the concept of \u201crisk\u201d has evolved in recent years. Between digital transformation and technological innovations, new data privacy laws, cyber vulnerabilities, and an increasing spotlight on corporate culture, values and diversity practices \u2014 risk management today is not your grandmother\u2019s limitation of liability clause. For today\u2019s legal departments, risk management goes hand-in-hand with data stewardship. What type of information is retained or destroyed is becoming just as important as how information is organized and leveraged. Yet, data disparity is on the rise.",

In 2021, Hanzo Hold will be the authoritative source for internal investigations, security checks, legal holds, and compliance archiving across all dynamic, complex content types.\r\n\r\nFollow-the-link functionality for G Suite within Slack is just one example of how Hanzo applies its mission by leveraging its deep experience in dynamic data today to help customers manage tomorrow's data challenges.\r\n\r\n\"Our customers have come to rely on Hanzo Hold's comprehensive Slack preservation, early case assessment, and review capabilities,\" said Brad Harris, VP of Product at Hanzo. \"Now, with the addition of G Suite and our roadmap for Google Workspace, we anticipate efficiencies well beyond initial expectations. We listen intently to the market and rely on our close partnership with our customers to ensure the software is built the way it is supposed to be built - with the customer in mind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Enterprise SaaS applications are in high demand mode, and the risk, legal and compliance challenges that present themselves as this application ecosystem expands are non-trivial,\" said Keith Laska, CEO of Hanzo. \"Hanzo made a long-term commitment to our Enterprise customers. We've pledged to listen, design, and build best-practice application layers for the identification, early case assessment, and exporting of critical data to industry-standard systems hosted by law firms and legal service providers such as Relativity, DISCO, and Reveal Data.

    "social_media_description": "<b>Rapid Product and Service Adoption, Aggressive International Growth Establishes DISCO as Trusted Innovation Partner</b>\r\n\r\n<i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Industry-Leading Net Promoter Score (NPS) Speaks to Best-in-Class Products and Services\u00a0</span></i>\r\n\r\n<b>AUSTIN \u2014 Feb. 2, 2021 \u2014</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> As legal organizations pivoted to manage the complexities of remote work, they turned to legal technology leader </span><a href=\"https://www.csdisco.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">DISCO</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> as a trusted partner to navigate cloud adoption and embrace advanced legal technology. The company today announced widespread adoption of enhanced ediscovery data management capabilities, industry-leading Net Promoter Scores (NPS), and a 300% increase in international business -- all positioning the company for aggressive growth in 2021 and beyond.\u00a0</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Data Management Suite within DISCO Ediscovery, which allows users to ingest, process, and remediate documents in a single platform, has been used by more than two thirds of DISCO\u2019s ediscovery customers to upload and transfer their own data. When legal teams transitioned to working from home, DISCO optimized its solution to deliver unprecedented speed and convenience, even in home office setups: the average data upload is 33 Mbps, or 2.75 terabytes per matter per day -- the equivalent of 170 million pages of documents that could fill 67,584 Bankers Boxes.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Today, DISCO is hosting more than 10 billion files, and DISCO\u2019s autoscaling infrastructure using AWS Lambda provisioned 13 billion server calls in the fourth quarter alone</span><b>.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0</span>\r\n\r\n<b>DISCO Products and Services Far Exceed Customer Expectations</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">DISCO uses Net Promoter Score (NPS) to determine customer satisfaction for its products and services. A company\u2019s NPS is generated by asking customers, \u201cHow likely is it that you would recommend [company/product/service] to a friend or colleague?\u201d.\u00a0</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Fifty-four percent of NPS respondents gave DISCO Ediscovery a 10 out of 10, for an overall NPS of 67. DISCO\u2019s professional services organization earned an NPS of 88, with 83% of respondents ranking DISCO a 10 out of 10. By way of comparison, </span><a href=\"https://www.retently.com/blog/good-net-promoter-score/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Retently</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> reports that enterprise software companies average an NPS of 44, and SaaS companies come in at 30. According to </span><a href=\"https://customer.guru/net-promoter-score/top-brands\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Customer Guru</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, DISCO\u2019s NPS is higher than all but three of 100 top brands. For example, the NPS for Apple is 47, Amazon is 25 and Netflix is 13 \u2014 all beloved and iconic companies with amazing products.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cDISCO has always focused on building \u2018Products Legal Loves.\u2019 Our stellar NPS results, customer growth and expansion, and product and service innovation make it clear that we are achieving this cornerstone goal,\u201d said DISCO CEO Kiwi Camara. \u201cLegal organizations are increasingly turning to DISCO to help them navigate the digital transformation that today\u2019s work environment demands. We remain focused on the development of a multi-product, full-stack solution that empowers the legal function: \u2018Technology That Powers Legal.\u2019\u201d</span>\r\n<h2><b>Technology Innovation, Experience With Global Matters Fueled 3x International Expansion</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Legal teams around the world are embracing DISCO for ediscovery and edisclosure, case management, and managed review. In 2020, DISCO\u2019s European Union client base doubled and EU revenue tripled, with customers including Clyde &amp; Co, Kennedys and Withersworldwide aggressively expanding their business with DISCO; the company has been hiring extensively to support and accelerate this demand. Global law firms are also increasingly engaging DISCO on international matters, as the company delivers products and services to address the legal needs of organizations across EMEA, Asia-Pacific and South America.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In addition to the speed, ease of use and associated cost savings that come with DISCO products, EU law firms also praise DISCO\u2019s native high-speed uploader, which provides a 14x improvement over traditional file transfer methods and 10% improvement over leading file transfer acceleration technologies. This unique, cutting-edge technology -- available exclusively from DISCO at no additional cost -- has proven exceptionally beneficial during the pandemic when traditional data collection and transfer methods are not possible.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cWorking with DISCO over the past several years, we have found more than an ediscovery provider - DISCO is a true strategic partner that helps us utilize technology to find our key evidence faster so we can better serve our clients,\u201d said Michael Silvain, Ediscovery Manager for Kennedys. \u201cThey empower our global teams to work faster, smarter, and to take advantage of advanced solutions and artificial intelligence to ensure even the obstacles of worldwide lockdowns and remote work are overcome. Beyond their exceptional products, DISCO\u2019s professional services team have supported our success across every matter, and that value is extended to our clients to help them win.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</span>\r\n<h2><b>About DISCO</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">DISCO is a legal technology company that applies artificial intelligence and cloud computing to legal problems to help lawyers and legal teams improve legal outcomes for their clients.

Customers who have operations in the UK will now be able to utilize Onna\u2019s powerful connectivity and data management functions, safe in the knowledge that their data is being hosted in the same country.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For Onna, this is the first regional instance of the technology outside of North America and brings the Onna technology offering to a more international customer base. In addition, customers that have business operations in the UK will now be able to extend their relationship with Onna and use the technology to address challenges outside of their US locations.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The addition of the UK operation will be available from February 2021 and will be hosted in the Google Cloud Platform region in London, UK. It extends Onna\u2019s capabilities globally by adding to the existing US-hosted operations.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Russ Grant, Vice President of Revenue, Onna, commented, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201c</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The UK instance of Onna brings our eDiscovery technology closer to customers in the UK, and allows us to meet their data residency requirements in line with the data protection and privacy rules in the region.\u201d He added, \u201cWe are providing our customers with more choice. If they </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">do not wish to have any data transferred to the US for processing or hosting, they now have the option to use the Onna UK instance. This will allow customers engaged in eDiscovery and data management projects on content hosted in the UK the ability to undertake this work without having to worry about the legal implications of transferring this data to the US.\u201d</span>\r\n\r\n<b>About Onna</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Onna integrates knowledge from all workplace applications, allowing anyone to unify, protect, search, automate, and build on top of their organization\u2019s proprietary knowledge. With the rise of cloud-based and hosted workplace apps, knowledge is extremely fragmented and difficult to access in most organizations, costing businesses huge amounts of time and money in searching for their own information. Onna\u2019s Machine Learning-based Knowledge Integration Platform can be connected to any cloud or on-premise application, including GSuite, Office 365, Slack, Dropbox, Salesforce, and many more. It supports eDiscovery, information governance, knowledge management, archiving, monitoring for private and sensitive data sharing, and building bespoke internal workflow apps using proprietary information.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With headquarters in New York City and Barcelona and teams in Raleigh, San Francisco, Toulouse, and London, Onna supports some of the world\u2019s leading companies, including Dropbox, Electronic Arts, Facebook, Fitbit, Lyft, NewsCorp, and Slack.

    "social_media_description": "<div class=\"container onna-blog-container has-onna-banner\">\r\n<div id=\"content-area\" class=\"clearfix\">\r\n<div class=\"onna-content-area\">\r\n<div class=\"onna-content-wrapper\"><article id=\"post-11439\" class=\"onna-blog\">\r\n<div id=\"onnaBlogContent\">\r\n\r\n<strong>Onna Blog: What is Information Governance and Why Is It So Important?</strong>\r\n\r\nEvery digital interaction between businesses and their customers leaves an auditable trail of data. Sometimes, data is highly sensitive and needs security, privacy, and discovery controls in place. Other times, data has no value and is simply taking up space. Telling the difference between these types of data and knowing where it all lives is one of the biggest challenges organizations face today.\r\n\r\nThe truth is an overwhelming amount of data is ungoverned making it difficult to know what is of value and what is not. Not only does this mean that sensitive data could be compromised, but also that potentially useful data remains underutilized. Having a robust information governance plan is the solution to these problems. Let\u2019s get into what it is and why it\u2019s important.\r\n<h2><strong>What is information governance?</strong></h2>\r\nInformation governance is defined in a lot of different ways, but at its core, it refers to a strategic framework for managing information at an organizational level. Although we typically refer to information governance in a digital context, it also incorporates physical assets, such as devices and printed documents. This is especially true in the case of more mature organizations, which often have large amounts of information stored locally, in printed or digital form.\r\n\r\nThere are many regional and international standards for managing information at scale, and the regulatory compliance landscape is evolving every year. However, the core concepts of information governance have largely remained the same. These include security and privacy, integrity and authenticity, information lifecycle management, and business continuity. But information governance is more than just a legal and ethical obligation. Establishing a robust and adaptable framework can help organizations derive greater value out of their information and drive smarter, more informed decision-making.\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img class=\"wp-image-11443 lazyloaded\" src=\"https://onna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2-1024x651.jpg\" alt=\"cloud-services_what-is-information-governance\" width=\"1024\" height=\"651\" data-attachment-id=\"11443\" data-permalink=\"https://onna.com/blog/what-is-information-governance-and-why-is-it-so-important/2-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://onna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1200,763\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://onna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2-300x191.jpg\" data-large-file=\"https://onna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2-1024x651.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://onna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2-1024x651.jpg 1024w, https://onna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2-980x623.jpg 980w, https://onna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2-480x305.jpg 480w\" data-src=\"https://onna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2-1024x651.jpg\" data-sizes=\"((min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px)) 480px, ((min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px)) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw\" /></figure>\r\n<h2>Why is information governance important?</h2>\r\nData overload is real, and it\u2019s one of the biggest challenges facing today\u2019s organizations. Our collective digital activities have now generated almost\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/871513/worldwide-data-created/\">60 zettabytes of data</a>, a figure that\u2019s expected to reach 149 over the next four years. In small businesses, data typically exists in the dozens of terabytes, while many larger enterprises have already reached the petabyte scale. These amounts are expected to only increase over the years to come.\r\n\r\nToday\u2019s organizations have the monumental task ahead of minimizing risk and maximizing value across increasingly vast data sets. While business leaders usually recognize the fact that their data is valuable, the overwhelming majority of their digital assets are underutilized and inadequately governed and protected. This isn\u2019t helped by the fact that the average enterprise now uses\u00a0<a href=\"https://chiefmartec.com/2020/02/average-enterprise-uses-1295-cloud-services/\">1,295 different cloud services</a>, each one leaving a trail of data across a complex array of networks and systems.\r\n<h2><strong>The difference between information management and information governance</strong></h2>\r\nYou might have heard the terms information management<em>\u00a0</em>and information governance used interchangeably, but they\u2019re actually two different tiers of scale. Information management is a subset of the broader information governance framework, which incorporates the capture, classification, storage, distribution, and preservation of information assets. It\u2019s largely reactive in that it encompasses responding to information requests, such as data subject access requests (DSARs) under GDPR and CCPA regulations. It also includes the secure disposal of obsolete data as required by internal company policies and regulatory compliance.\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img class=\"wp-image-11446 lazyloaded\" src=\"https://onna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/3-1024x529.jpg\" alt=\"gdpr-ccpa_what-is-information-governance\" width=\"1024\" height=\"529\" data-attachment-id=\"11446\" data-permalink=\"https://onna.com/blog/what-is-information-governance-and-why-is-it-so-important/3-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://onna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/3.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1200,620\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://onna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/3-300x155.jpg\" data-large-file=\"https://onna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/3-1024x529.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://onna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/3-1024x529.jpg 1024w, https://onna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/3-980x506.jpg 980w, https://onna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/3-480x248.jpg 480w\" data-src=\"https://onna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/3-1024x529.jpg\" data-sizes=\"((min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px)) 480px, ((min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px)) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw\" /></figure>\r\nInformation governance has a much broader scope, and what it encompasses varies from one organization to the next. For the most part, it refers to a company\u2019s internal policies and processes for optimizing information management in line with business goals. For example, this might mean reducing operational costs, deriving insights from big data, or even deploying machine-learning algorithms for automated management and governance. In other words, IG goes beyond the systematic management of records and information to incorporate a wide-ranging approach to supporting an organization\u2019s objectives, policies, and standards.\r\n<h2><strong>Information governance as an evolving discipline and a driver of innovation</strong></h2>\r\nSome business leaders think of information governance purely as a legal requirement. But it\u2019s not all about building a legally defensible program for managing sensitive information. IG is a fast-evolving discipline, which has become a critical business routine in today\u2019s data-heavy age. There\u2019s now a constant need to re-assess IG in line with the advancement of enterprise technology. It\u2019s not a strategy that\u2019s implemented once and then left to run its course \u2013 it\u2019s a journey rather than a destination. In fact, the same can be said of IG\u2019s overarching discipline, which is\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.cio.com/article/3211428/what-is-digital-transformation-a-necessary-disruption.html\">digital transformation</a>.\r\n\r\nWithout an adaptable IG strategy, it\u2019s impossible for an organization to innovate without adding risk. Fast-changing enterprise technology landscapes, paired with a rapidly accelerating datasphere, mean that there are new risks and opportunities alike. These both need to be managed at a massive scale in an age when enterprises have their information assets stored across a multitude of cloud-hosted apps and online storage facilities, employee- and business-owned mobile devices, and in-house desktops and servers. Factor in the rise of the internet of things (IoT), and there\u2019s no denying the massive scope and scale of today\u2019s information governance requirements.\r\n\r\nImplementing robust information governance policies and processes gives today\u2019s companies the opportunity to innovate without increasing risk. For example, let\u2019s say you\u2019re rolling out a new employee communication platform that will enhance productivity among remote workers:\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img class=\"wp-image-11449 lazyloaded\" src=\"https://onna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/4-1024x286.jpg\" alt=\"slack-ediscovery_what-is-information-governance\" width=\"1024\" height=\"286\" data-attachment-id=\"11449\" data-permalink=\"https://onna.com/blog/what-is-information-governance-and-why-is-it-so-important/4-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://onna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/4.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"2000,559\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"4\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://onna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/4-300x84.jpg\" data-large-file=\"https://onna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/4-1024x286.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://onna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/4-980x274.jpg 980w, https://onna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/4-480x134.jpg 480w\" data-src=\"https://onna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/4-1024x286.jpg\" data-sizes=\"((min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px)) 480px, ((min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px)) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw\" /></figure>\r\n<h2><strong>Overcoming the challenges of scale across business roles</strong></h2>\r\nBefore any organization embarks on an overhaul of their information governance policies and procedures, it\u2019s important to consider the challenges first. These can include:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>The complexity and diversity of today\u2019s enterprise technology stacks</li>\r\n \t<li>The rapid proliferation of data across all business roles and departments</li>\r\n \t<li>The new and emerging data privacy regulations at local, state, federal, and global levels</li>\r\n \t<li>The need to derive real-time insights from data to maintain competitive advantage</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe above responsibilities apply in almost every business role and department. In enterprise environments, matters become exponentially more complex, especially when factoring in the rise of remote teams and multiple branches. Different departments use a wide range of cloud services. For example, marketing teams use on average 120 different services, while HR use around 100, and finance uses 51, according to one\u00a0<a href=\"https://chiefmartec.com/2020/02/average-enterprise-uses-1295-cloud-services/\">recent study</a>. Since each of these services collects and stores information in a unique way, information governance must apply in every area of the organization.\r\n\r\nInformation Governance no longer belongs exclusively to legal, compliance, and information security teams. It\u2019s everyone\u2019s responsibility. IG professionals need visibility across the full range of information-based services. Business leaders need to maintain complete audit trails of where their data lives and which controls are in place to protect it.\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img class=\"wp-image-11451 lazyloaded\" src=\"https://onna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/5-1024x648.jpg\" alt=\"privacy-policy_what-is-information-governance\" width=\"1024\" height=\"648\" data-attachment-id=\"11451\" data-permalink=\"https://onna.com/blog/what-is-information-governance-and-why-is-it-so-important/5-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://onna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/5.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1500,949\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"5\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://onna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/5-300x190.jpg\" data-large-file=\"https://onna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/5-1024x648.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://onna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/5-980x620.jpg 980w, https://onna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/5-480x304.jpg 480w\" data-src=\"https://onna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/5-1024x648.jpg\" data-sizes=\"((min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px)) 480px, ((min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px)) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw\" /></figure>\r\nSince information governance involves every business-critical role, today\u2019s enterprises need a single, secure, and centralized way to access and manage their entire technology stack and all the data that comes with it. It\u2019s about simplifying\u00a0large and complex technology environments by bringing everything together under a unified management system where it\u2019s possible to apply and enforce their policies. Maintaining a centralized data repository helps enterprises leverage the information available to them in new and intuitive ways.\r\n<h2><strong>6 information governance initiatives every business leader should follow</strong></h2>\r\nAs one of the integral disciplines of digital transformation, information governance strategies have the potential to drive innovation and empower exponential growth. However, like every business transformation program, there are certain rules and standards to abide by and pitfalls to avoid. Here are our top recommendations to help you supercharge information governance in your organization:\r\n\r\n<strong>1. Identify an executive-level sponsor</strong>\r\n\r\nEvery business transformation program requires support from leadership. If your information governance initiative doesn\u2019t have someone driving it, it will be far less likely to succeed. Larger companies should establish an IG board or committee that maintains strong links throughout the company and engages leaders across the full range of business roles. Recruiting an engaged sponsor who understands the language of business, and not just the language of compliance and IT, will greatly increase the chances of any changes being accepted.\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img class=\"wp-image-11456 lazyloaded\" src=\"https://onna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/6-1024x451.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"451\" data-attachment-id=\"11456\" data-permalink=\"https://onna.com/blog/what-is-information-governance-and-why-is-it-so-important/attachment/6/\" data-orig-file=\"https://onna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/6.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1500,661\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"6\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://onna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/6-300x132.jpg\" data-large-file=\"https://onna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/6-1024x451.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://onna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/6-980x432.jpg 980w, https://onna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/6-480x212.jpg 480w\" data-src=\"https://onna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/6-1024x451.jpg\" data-sizes=\"((min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px)) 480px, ((min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px)) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw\" /></figure>\r\n<strong>2. Take an org-wide approach</strong>\r\n\r\nMany organizations view information governance as nothing but an IT project, but it really takes cooperation from the entire organization. Anywhere data lives, and anyone who touches it needs to be on board for your IG strategy to be successful. Communicating what your IG strategy can bring to different business roles and how they can improve them is paramount to getting participation from all sides of the organization.\u00a0Eventually, you want your strategy to be integrated with wider corporate culture and become central to everything you do, but first, you must demonstrate value and get buy-in.\r\n\r\n<strong>3. Educate employees on an ongoing basis</strong>\r\n\r\nThe same way you need to get buy-in from you\u2019re organization, you need to ensure people understand and follow IG company policies. To ensure employees comply with legal, security, and privacy obligations, a suitable training and development program is vital. Education should be an ongoing process, not just a one and done presentation or seminar. By keeping education alive through a cadence, you ensure nothing slips through the cracks. To see policies ingrained in employees\u2019 day-to-day lives, it\u2019s also important to demonstrate the true value of your policies. Whether that means increasing efficiency or making more data-driven decisions, strong information governance can change the way\u00a0<em>everyone</em>\u00a0works for the better.\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img class=\"wp-image-11459 lazyloaded\" src=\"https://onna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/7-1024x532.jpg\" alt=\"data-policy_what-is-information-governance\" width=\"1024\" height=\"532\" data-attachment-id=\"11459\" data-permalink=\"https://onna.com/blog/what-is-information-governance-and-why-is-it-so-important/attachment/7/\" data-orig-file=\"https://onna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/7.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1500,779\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"7\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://onna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/7-300x156.jpg\" data-large-file=\"https://onna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/7-1024x532.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://onna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/7-980x509.jpg 980w, https://onna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/7-480x249.jpg 480w\" data-src=\"https://onna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/7-1024x532.jpg\" data-sizes=\"((min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px)) 480px, ((min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px)) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw\" /></figure>\r\n<strong>4. Understand your information lifecycle</strong>\r\n\r\nInformation doesn\u2019t have an inherent lifespan, but it does need to have a predefined lifecycle from the moment it\u2019s first collected to the moment it\u2019s archived or securely disposed of. How long information spends in each stage of the lifecycle and why will vary enormously depending on its content, type, and industry. You should always start by addressing legal factors like privacy regulations to inform what your information lifecycle should look like. After you\u2019ve addressed more pressing legal obligations and business priorities, you can move into standard lifecycle processes that affect the organization at large and document how information should be collected, stored, processed, archived, and disposed of.\r\n\r\n<strong>5. Choose the right tools and solutions</strong>\r\n\r\nDue to the challenges of scale brought on by the explosion of data and the increasing range of devices and software used, it\u2019s impossible to achieve full oversight using manual means alone. Every organization needs a powerful, automated approach to managing data throughout every stage of its existence. In enterprise environments, processes that require automation include the application of retention policies, archival, and classification. The main goal should be to implement a platform that brings all your apps and data together under a centrally managed system. Ideally, your IG strategy should adapt seamlessly to evolving technology and corporate environments. An IG initiative that can\u2019t scale and adapt to the future will only end up stifling innovation.\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img class=\"wp-image-11462 lazyloaded\" src=\"https://onna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8-1024x582.jpg\" alt=\"information-governance-tools_what-is-information-governance\" width=\"1024\" height=\"582\" data-attachment-id=\"11462\" data-permalink=\"https://onna.com/blog/what-is-information-governance-and-why-is-it-so-important/attachment/8/\" data-orig-file=\"https://onna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1500,852\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"8\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://onna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8-300x170.jpg\" data-large-file=\"https://onna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8-1024x582.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://onna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8-980x557.jpg 980w, https://onna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8-480x273.jpg 480w\" data-src=\"https://onna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8-1024x582.jpg\" data-sizes=\"((min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px)) 480px, ((min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px)) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw\" /></figure>\r\n<strong>6. \u00a0Incorporate data-driven decision-making</strong>\r\n\r\nBig data refers to data sets that are beyond human capabilities to make sense of. But big data also presents a wealth of opportunity for businesses to derive valuable insights into their internal operations, customers, supply chains, and more. By centralizing otherwise fragmented and underutilized data from your wider technology environment, you can stay ahead of the curve with informed, real-time decision-making. IG plays a crucial role in making data readily available to authorized parties and enabling them to access and use it in ways that add value throughout the organization.\r\n\r\nCurious how Onna can unify your information governance processes?

    "social_media_description": "<strong>Onna Blog: Unified Information Governance: Reconciling Conflicts Between Stakeholders</strong>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://onna.com/blog/what-is-information-governance-and-why-is-it-so-important/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Information governance</a>\u00a0is a critical discipline that encompasses many parts of the business. Compliance, security, legal, and IT all have an important stake in managing information; however, when it comes to handling that information, conflict can arise. Priorities may differ when it comes to data retention, archival, and deletion, leading to difficult decision-making. Add in the pressures of data privacy laws, like\u00a0<a href=\"https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/\">GD</a><a href=\"https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">P</a><a href=\"https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/\">R</a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"https://onna.com/blog/how-to-maintain-ccpa-compliance-in-the-cloud/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">CCPA</a>, and the perils of disunity only intensify.\r\n\r\nSo what does the decision-making process look like when legal wants to retain data but IT wants to delete it \u2014 both with valid reasons? How can organizations avoid spending on outside counsel to weigh-in on internal decisions? If these questions resonate with you, it might be time to take a hard look at what information governance means in your organization. More likely than not, you are taking a siloed approach to information management that has your people working against, rather than with, one another.\r\n\r\nHere are six ways to align information stakeholders and proactively avert conflict.\r\n<h3>1.\u00a0<strong>Formalize stakeholder relationships</strong></h3>\r\nAll too often, information stakeholders are thrust into meeting for the first time because of urgent matters, such as litigation or discovery requests. These matters require cross-functional collaboration, and yet crucial relationships may not be defined. To ensure all stakeholders are connected, you may want to start an\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.ciodive.com/news/4-keys-to-managing-an-information-governance-program/554621/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">information governance steering committee</a>\u00a0comprising key members from security, compliance, privacy, legal, IT, and other lines of business that hold essential company information \u2014 like HR or finance. By proactively bringing stakeholders together and formalizing their roles and responsibilities, you can foster clear communication and coordination from the get-go.\r\n<h3>2.\u00a0<strong>Understand information\u2019s value from all perspectives</strong></h3>\r\nCompany information is multifaceted. It lives in different places and serves different purposes, so its lifecycle isn\u2019t clear-cut \u2014 nor is its treatment. For example, while\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.csoonline.com/article/3215864/how-to-protect-personally-identifiable-information-pii-under-gdpr.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">personally identifiable information (PII)</a>\u00a0may need to be held for regulatory compliance reasons, you might want your year-over-year company performance metrics for business strategy purposes. To avoid miscommunication and conflict, your information governance framework needs to address the value of information from all angles. To start, you can ask questions like: What purpose does this data serve? What department(s) are concerned with this data and why? How might this data pose risk, maximize value, or both? The sooner teams address information from a holistic view, rather than a siloed view, the better.\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img class=\"wp-image-12225 lazyloaded\" src=\"https://onna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unified-information-governance-1024x513.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"513\" data-attachment-id=\"12225\" data-permalink=\"https://onna.com/blog/unified-information-governance-reconciling-conflicts-between-stakeholders/unified-information-governance/\" data-orig-file=\"https://onna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unified-information-governance.png\" data-orig-size=\"1500,752\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"unified-information-governance\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://onna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unified-information-governance-300x150.png\" data-large-file=\"https://onna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unified-information-governance-1024x513.png\" data-srcset=\"https://onna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unified-information-governance-980x491.png 980w, https://onna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unified-information-governance-480x241.png 480w\" data-src=\"https://onna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unified-information-governance-1024x513.png\" data-sizes=\"((min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px)) 480px, ((min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px)) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw\" /></figure>\r\n<h3>3. Make a plan for potential conflicts with risk front-of-mind</h3>\r\nOnce you map out the answers to these questions, you can start to spot overlap and conflict in priorities. Although every organization is different, the most common conflict arises around the question of retention \u2014 whether to keep or delete. Although you might be legally bound to retain information, you might also be required to delete information for privacy matters. In scenarios like this, it\u2019s crucial that the necessary stakeholders come together to resolve issues, and not just the ones in conflict. Depending on the situation, you may need the input of separate stakeholders, such as IT, to help you understand what technical solutions are possible. Regardless of the nature of your potential conflicts, identifying them early on will help you get ahead of pain, risk, and confusion.\r\n<h3>4. Develop an information governance policy</h3>\r\nAfter you outline stakeholder relationships and identify potential conflicts, you\u2019ll want to bake those solutions into your information governance policy. There\u2019s a lot to consider in developing a policy, but a good rule of thumb is to focus on people, process, and technology. You\u2019ll also want to break it into two portions: minimizing risk and maximizing value.\r\n\r\nOn the minimizing risk front, narrowing down legal, compliance, and privacy obligations first will ensure the most critical protocols are covered. This could include anything from the who/when/how of handling yearly audits to\u00a0<a href=\"https://onna.com/blog/how-to-develop-an-effective-data-retention-policy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">creating a data retention policy</a>. Once that\u2019s done, you can move on to the data maximization portion, which informs how you will protect and utilize your information. This could be anything from handling eDiscovery to data loss prevention measures. Every company\u2019s policy may look different, but the one thing that should remain consistent is alignment from all information stakeholders.\r\n<h3>5. Assign roles and responsibilities</h3>\r\nOnce you develop an information governance policy, you\u2019ll want to make sure every stakeholder understands their roles and responsibilities. This ensures your framework is put into practice effectively. Every organization looks different, but a good way to delegate responsibilities among each department is branching down from the executive level to working groups. Executives, such as the CIO, CSO, General Counsel, and others can operate as key decision-makers, and different departments, such as security, IT, and compliance, can form working groups to encourage better data stewardship over their own information.\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img class=\"wp-image-12228 lazyloaded\" src=\"https://onna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unified-information-governance_stakeholders-1024x460.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"460\" data-attachment-id=\"12228\" data-permalink=\"https://onna.com/blog/unified-information-governance-reconciling-conflicts-between-stakeholders/unified-information-governance_stakeholders/\" data-orig-file=\"https://onna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unified-information-governance_stakeholders.png\" data-orig-size=\"1500,674\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"unified-information-governance_stakeholders\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://onna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unified-information-governance_stakeholders-300x135.png\" data-large-file=\"https://onna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unified-information-governance_stakeholders-1024x460.png\" data-srcset=\"https://onna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unified-information-governance_stakeholders-980x440.png 980w, https://onna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unified-information-governance_stakeholders-480x216.png 480w\" data-src=\"https://onna.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unified-information-governance_stakeholders-1024x460.png\" data-sizes=\"((min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px)) 480px, ((min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px)) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw\" /></figure>\r\n<h3>6. Unify your information in one place</h3>\r\nYou can have all the right people and policies in place, but without the right technology, it can still be a challenge to locate your most vital information \u2014 which can lead to stakeholder conflict. Especially when it comes to the scattered, proliferating nature of cloud applications, keeping tabs on dynamic data such as messages, threads, and attachments in so many locations can be daunting. More often than not, teams end up heavily relying on IT to expend more time and resources. Implementing a solution that\u00a0<a href=\"https://onna.com/features/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">brings all of your siloed data in one private, secure, and searchable place</a>\u00a0can make it easier for stakeholders to find what they need at a moment\u2019s notice. Not only can this help you avert future conflict, but also reduce risk, maximize value, and enhance compliance.\r\n\r\nOrganizations have a huge opportunity to leverage key information to help realize their goals \u2014 but first, their governance framework must guide key stakeholders towards alignment. By focusing on the factors we\u2019ve discussed, you can start to transform your information governance plan to work for your people, not against them.",

    "social_media_description": "<p id=\"h-zapproved-collaborated-with-onna-to-empower-corporate-legal-teams-to-more-effectively-manage-unstructured-data-and-make-information-more-discoverable\"><strong>Zapproved Collaborates with Onna to Empower Corporate Legal Teams To More Effectively Manage Unstructured Data and Make Information More Discoverable</strong></p>\r\nPortland, OR \u2014 3 February 2021:\u00a0<a href=\"https://onna.com/\">Onna</a>, the world\u2019s first Knowledge Integration Platform on a mission to make enterprise information accessible, useful and private, has collaborated with\u00a0<a href=\"https://zapproved.com/\">Zapproved</a>\u00a0to build a direct integration between its ZDiscovery platform and Onna\u2019s Knowledge Integration Platform. This announcement marks a significant milestone in Onna\u2019s collaboration with leading legal technology companies to drive a better experience for customers.\r\n\r\nWith the exponential growth in the adoption of cloud tools and increased fragmentation of data, this new integration will allow corporate legal teams to more effectively preserve, collect, process and review all the relevant data in their organization directly from ZDiscovery for sources like Slack, Zoom and Microsoft Teams. By connecting seamlessly to Onna\u2019s API, Zapproved users are able to select which source to create a hold on and which users the hold applies to along with an optional date range.\r\n\r\nOnna\u2019s Knowledge Integration Platform is a leading ediscovery solution that is making information across numerous apps less fragmented and more discoverable for legal teams across the globe. Combining the power of both the Onna and Zapproved platforms, allows users to:\r\n<ul class=\"zp-indented\">\r\n \t<li>Conduct real-time ediscovery collections across all unstructured data sources</li>\r\n \t<li>Maintain an audit log of all ediscovery collections</li>\r\n \t<li>Enable users to run advanced searches across all data sources including specific channels and users</li>\r\n \t<li>Export data in multiple formats to upload to document review platforms</li>\r\n \t<li>Set up smart alerts to notify organizations any time there is sensitive or important information being transmitted</li>\r\n \t<li>Create groups within Onna with service providers and outside counsel to collaborate on matters and ediscovery requests</li>\r\n \t<li>Preserve and archive communications in their native, unaltered format, either wholly or in a granular fashion</li>\r\n \t<li>Initiate legal holds across specific data sources, users and/or channels</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\u201cOur collaboration with Zapproved is an important milestone in providing further value to our customers across the full breadth of ediscovery. Allowing them to search both structured and unstructured data and making it more discoverable will be a key factor in legal teams being able to conduct real-time collections.\u201d said Kelly Griswold, COO, Onna.\r\n\r\nRekha Shenoy, CPO, Zapproved commented, \u201cIn the past 12 months, we started to notice a trend in the market with customers moving away from managing all their retention policies, preservations and information governance in each individual application they managed. Instead they were moving towards bundling all their data into a single location. We identified Onna to be at the forefront of that movement.\u201d Rekha continues, \u201cEmpowering users to be able to preserve and collect data wherever it lives, was a key factor in our collaboration with Onna. Providing our customers with a best-in-class collaboration solution, with tight integration, allows both Zapproved and Onna to play to their strengths.\u201d\r\n\r\n<strong>About Zapproved</strong>\r\n\r\nZapproved\u2019s ZDiscovery platform is designed specifically for corporate legal teams. With this platform, you\r\ncan take control of ediscovery from the moment litigation is anticipated until the matter is resolved. Our\r\npowerful yet intuitive system equips teams to reduce reliance on outside providers, dramatically lower costs,\r\nand build a better process. Backed by ironclad security and unrivaled customer support, our enterprise-class\r\nsoftware is trusted by more corporate legal teams than any other.

Your Case for Contract Lifecycle Management</a></span></span>\r\n<h2><strong>#3 \u2013 Contract Negotiation Automation</strong></h2>\r\nGeneral Counsel, paralegals, and other legal contract stakeholders no longer need to rely upon a\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.cobblestonesoftware.com/blog/contract-negotiations-with-contract-insight\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>contract negotiations</strong></a>\u00a0process that depends on redlining and back-and-forth communication.\r\n\r\nWith contract negotiation automation proffered by robust legal contract management software solutions, document collaboration and document version control are simplified with numbered version tracking and a detailed log of document iterations.\u00a0 Collaborative parties can maintain version control with the capability to upload and download up-to-date document versions with ease.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.cobblestonesoftware.com/blog/contract-clauses-mastering-contract-management-series\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Clause ownership functionality</strong></a>\u00a0makes it so that organizations can assign clause owners.\u00a0 If a party attempts to edit a clause, advanced contract management software can add that clause\u2019s owner to the approval process.\u00a0 Consequently, only necessary parties are added to the negotiation process, as per rules-based clause ownership.\r\n\r\nContract negotiations between internal negotiating parties, external parties, and employee non-users of software are more efficient when organizations are equipped to configure a rules-based process.\u00a0 A pre-configured workflow permits contract stakeholders to receive a notification that takes them to a contract collaboration portal.\u00a0 There, relevant documents can be accessed for review.\u00a0 A benefit of this process is that external parties and employees without\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.cobblestonesoftware.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>contract management software</strong></a>\u00a0access can view and edit contracts that are assigned to them but cannot access core system features and contracts that are not pertinent to them.\u00a0 Documents that are needed are isolated so that stakeholders can view or make changes right from the portal.\u00a0 Furthermore, contract parties can engage in approval collaboration in a centralized location and receive alerts about the approval process \u2013 in the interest of reducing delays.\r\n\r\nWith an advantageous contract negotiation portal, legal\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.cobblestonesoftware.com/blog/easy-contract-collaboration\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">contract collaboration</a>\u00a0is efficient and straightforward.\r\n<h2><strong>#4 \u2013 Obligations Workflow</strong></h2>\r\nDiligent observance of contract obligation fulfillment is critical for healthy contract lifecycles.\u00a0 Contract workflow automation that leverages automated alerts, notifications, task escalation, and approval routing helps organizations to meet their contractual needs and focus their attention on more strategic aspects of contract management \u2013 such as opportunity realization and\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.cobblestonesoftware.com/blog/5-critical-decisions-driven-by-contract-data\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>data analytics</strong></a>.\r\n\r\nObligations workflow can be configured within legal contract management software to trigger when specific criteria are met, before contract execution, after contract execution, or both.\u00a0 Flexible obligations management promotes a culture where the proper alerts, notifications, and approvals are set in place for contracts at the right time.\r\n<h2><strong>#5 \u2013 Compliance &amp; Auditing Tools</strong></h2>\r\nAdvanced compliance reporting and auditing tools give legal teams visibility into contractual relationships across entities and businesses.\u00a0 Legal compliance standards can be easily maintained with robust and user-friendly reporting metrics, key dates, and renewals.\r\n\r\nLeading-edge legal contract management software also offers integration with\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.cobblestonesoftware.com/blog/ofac-search-made-easy-with-contract-management-software\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>OFAC search</strong></a>\u00a0data.\u00a0 This helpful compliance tool checks vendor, company, and employee data and compares it to data within OFAC\u2019s (The Office of Foreign Assets Control) sanctions lists \u2013 providing crucial risk analysis snapshots.\r\n<h2><strong>#6 \u2013 Legal Contract Management Reports</strong></h2>\r\nAd-hoc reports equip organizations with reports on upcoming tasks, user-defined status reports, reports on financial commitments, and more.\u00a0 Reports can be emailed on a scheduled basis or swiftly exported to spreadsheets to save locally and distribute.\r\n\r\nWith an online report designer, general counsel and paralegals can use contract management software to establish easily configured and flexible report layouts to display critical contract information.\u00a0 These report designers include many file exportation options, such as PDF, MS Word, spreadsheets, various image formats, rich text, CSV, and more!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.cobblestonesoftware.com/blog/contract-insight-executive-graphical-dashboards\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Executive graphical dashboards</strong></a>\u00a0deliver a comprehensive overview of key dates, activities, and contract performance.\r\n\r\nWith the help of advanced\u00a0<strong><a href=\"https://www.cobblestonesoftware.com/blog/tracking-and-reporting-financial-data-contract-insight\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">financials tracking</a></strong>, improved searching, and reporting tools, legal teams can track payments, spending, and contract data changes.\r\n<h2><strong>#7 \u2013 AI-Powered Risk Management</strong></h2>\r\nFastidious\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.cobblestonesoftware.com/blog/assessing-contract-risk-early-identification-and-prevention\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>risk management</strong></a>\u00a0is paramount for successful legal contract management. \u00a0<a href=\"https://www.cobblestonesoftware.com/blog/what-is-ai-based-contract-management\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>AI-based contract management software</strong></a>\u00a0makes risk assessment, analysis, and mitigation more manageable and efficient.\r\n\r\nA risk score can keep your legal contract management team accountable by equipping them with an outline of how well (or how poorly) they are leveraging their risk tools.\u00a0 From there, they can act accordingly to establish the best possible risk management process.\r\n<div class=\"hs-embed-wrapper\" data-service=\"youtube\" data-responsive=\"true\">\r\n<div class=\"hs-embed-content-wrapper\">\r\n<div></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<strong>Watch the VISDOM\u00ae AI video.</strong>\r\n\r\nAdvanced legal contract management software also provides risk rating and risk mapping features.\u00a0 Risk profile ratings can help legal teams to visualize risk.\u00a0 Based on tracked risk, users are provided with a risk assessment matrix.\u00a0 They can view risk probability patterns for events that may occur within contracts, as well as risk exposure that results from those events.\r\n\r\nAwareness of potentially detrimental risk events can help general counsel and paralegals to decide how to move forward with a contract.\u00a0 Risk visualization can help teams make risk management decisions more efficiently and more effectually.\r\n<h2><strong>Experience Next-Level Legal Contract Management!</strong></h2>\r\nNow you know the cutting-edge

    "social_media_description": "Filevine introduces enhancements to the Filevine legal work platform to make work more seamless, transparent, and effortless for legal professionals and everyone they interact with.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFilevine announced several product improvements focused on the future of legal work at their annual user conference, Legal X, which took place Sept. 27-29 in Salt Lake City. With several exciting guest and keynote speakers, the conference focused on identifying what's next for the intersection of technology and legal innovation.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"https://filevine-marketing-production-media.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/media/images/blogs/2021/10/tues-mainstage-200.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\r\n<blockquote>\u201cFilevine started out because legal professionals needed a better case management system,\u201d said Ryan Anderson, CEO and cofounder of Filevine. \u201cBut it has become much more than that. Legal work is dually critical and cumbersome at all businesses - no matter the business\u2019 size or industry. Legal X brings together many of the professionals committed to improving the legal profession using technology. We\u2019re excited about the learnings that will come from this year\u2019s event.\u201d</blockquote>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nEmphasizing the company's belief that changing the way legal work gets done can help legal professionals deliver better results, the theme of the event, \u201cA Better Way Forward,\u201d helps attendees explore how to find a better way forward as teams, leaders, advocates, innovators, and people. The event featured keynote speakers including, Ben Crump, Ally Love, Abby Wambach, and Alexis Ohanian, as well as dozens of breakout speakers, from Filevine employees and users to industry thought leaders. Filevine also planned a Women in Legal Luncheon and a Legal X party featuring Jimmy Eat World.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"img-fluid\" src=\"https://filevine-marketing-production-media.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/media/images/blogs/2021/10/crump-120.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Legal X, Filevine users benefited from hands-on workshops and demonstrations from leading legal experts. Filevine is also announcing new product updates and improvements, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Outlaw debuts its clause library solution reimagined. The unique Clause Lookup feature powers auto-complete when drafting, and dynamic linking of clauses automatically keeps disparate templates synchronized whenever the master is updated. This provides legal teams a new and accelerated way of drafting their best contracts, all while retaining 100% control over design.</li>\r\n \t<li>Docs+ provides robust document management for Filevine users. Because documents are central to legal work, Docs+ is central to Filevine\u2019s legal work platform. Advancements to navigation, upload &amp; retrieval, sharing, and more enable customers to both improve file management (storing, organizing, and securing) and document work (editing, sharing, and communicating).</li>\r\n \t<li>Tag Management builds on hashtags by giving users the power to standardize the way their organization indexes information. From documents and projects, to contacts and notes, legal teams can now simplify, search, and sort their data - their way.</li>\r\n \t<li>With the launch of powerful new Time Tracking features, legal practitioners can now integrate timekeeping deeply into their workflow. Time Tracking from Filevine allows you to track time via tasks, calendar events, Outlook, and much more\u2014all in one place. Less busy work, more real work.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<blockquote>\u201cOrganizations have relied on traditional systems of case management for years. In today\u2019s world, that is no longer enough to keep up with fast-paced and constantly-evolving business,\u201d said Jen Gray, VP of Product Marketing at Filevine. \u201cFilevine is enabling all legal teams to move into more holistic legal work solutions with tools to manage, track, and collaborate on\u2014and ultimately, deliver\u2014better legal work.\u201d</blockquote>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWith hundreds of legal professionals attending the conference amid ongoing changes to the state of the COVID-19 pandemic, Filevine required attendees to be vaccinated and took necessary precautions to ensure the health and safety of all guests. Masks and social distancing were also encouraged.\r\n\r\nFilevine has helped thousands of legal professionals with case and document management since its founding in 2014 and has since evolved into a complete legal work platform \u2014 facilitating lead management, esignatures, business analytics, and more. After the recent acquisition of Outlaw, the leading contract lifecycle management platform, Filevine has further increased its dedication to improving the exchange and collaboration of legal work for both legal teams and the clients they serve.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<blockquote>\"I've come home [from Legal X] with improvements to make our work better and help us better serve our clients. I also come home with some practical advice, legal advice, and business advice. Filevine puts on a first-rate event,\" said Ryan McKeen, partner and trial attorney at Connecticut Trial Firm.</blockquote>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFilevine believes in a brighter future where the intersection of legal work and business is made more seamless, transparent, and effortless for all legal professionals and everyone they interact with through the power of legal technology.\r\n\r\n<b>About Filevine</b>\r\n\r\nFilevine is changing the way legal work gets done for law practitioners and their clients.

    "short_description": "10 Ways Case Management Software Can Help You Attract and Retain Talent",
    "social_media_description": "<i>Want the highest-quality lawyers and staff? Use\u00a0<a>legal case management software</a>\u00a0to fight burn-out and build a better place to work.</i>\r\n\r\nSome are calling this moment \u201cThe Great Resignation.\u201d Workers across all industries and skill levels are leaving their jobs for greener pastures. Within the legal industry, this means more lateral hires, with many firms offering huge sign-on bonuses to lure in talent from elsewhere.\r\n\r\nBut it\u2019s not just about the money. Legal professionals are also resigning out of frustration with stressful, inflexible, or poorly-managed workplaces. Bloomberg Law reports that over the last year, attorneys felt burnt out 40-50% of the time.<sup><small>1</small></sup>\r\n\r\nBurnout levels like these aren\u2019t sustainable. The firms that do best during the \u2018Great Resignation\u2019 will be those that focus on fighting burn-out, and making the labor of law better for every member of the team.\r\n\r\n<b>Here are 10 ways that case management software can be used to improve the experience of working in a law office, and help you keep the talent you need to move forward:</b>\r\n<h2>1. Allow remote work</h2>\r\nOne big reason many give for leaving their jobs is the lack of workplace flexibility. With lingering health concerns, family obligations, and long commutes, many are reluctant to be in an office full-time.\r\n\r\nCloud-based case management software is your best friend when it comes to enabling remote work. Lawyers and staff can access all needed case information from any device, clearly see their tasks and deadlines, collaborate on document drafts and assign work to others, even send and receive texts from within the clients\u2019 case files.\r\n\r\nSome legal professionals prefer to work full-time in an office, away from the stressors and distractions of home. Some want one remote day each week. With cloud-based case management software, you have the tools you need to respond rapidly to your team\u2019s unique requirements and preferences.\r\n<h2>2. Tame notifications</h2>\r\nWhen every person in a city drives a car, the fastest mode of transportation quickly becomes the slowest. A similar principle can happen with notifications: when you\u2019re constantly distracted by a stream of texts and emails and instant messages about every change on every desktop and phone app you use, you\u2019re less informed and productive than you would be with no notifications at all.\r\n\r\nThe first step to taming notifications is to centralize communication and updates into one system. Instead of sometimes texting, sometimes calling, sometimes emailing, and occasionally sending an instant message, funnel all communication through the case management system. Reserve more disruptive methods like calls, texts, or in-person interruptions for truly urgent issues.\r\n\r\nSecondly, make sure that your centralized system has options for how and when team members get notified. While some might want to get an email or Slack message for each update, make sure they also have the power to choose less frequent, more contained scheduled notifications, to decrease interruptions and help them focus on the work at hand.\r\n<h2>3. Stop micromanaging</h2>\r\nMany forms of technology can be used to surveil and badger team members. But the sense that a boss is constantly looking over your shoulder quickly leads to burnout. Smart managers will resist the temptation to micromanage and instead use technology to provide more autonomy and flexibility to workers.\r\n\r\nWith case management software, you can have automated procedures in place that ensure a timely workflow and generate products that meet high standards (for instance, you can give paralegals a button that automatically generates a personalized, accurate document, instead of making them retype it each time). Keep your eye on final products and approaching due dates, and allow each team member to get there in the manner that suits them.\r\n<h2>4. Cut out the busy work</h2>\r\nNobody goes to law school in order to spend their days retyping the same form. By strategically deploying automation, you can give lawyers and staff more time to connect with clients and do the kind of work that\u2019s more meaningful to them.\r\n\r\nCentralized case management systems can cut out redundant data entry and automatically generate professional, personalized documents. Contract management tools like Outlaw can take the tedium out of work. Rather than endlessly pouring over fine print, you can use advanced contract templates, track each version, and reach meaningful agreement faster.\r\n<h2>5. Provide more realistic work expectations</h2>\r\nBecause it speeds up and simplifies routine legal work, case management software can help reign in expanding workweeks. Advanced analytics can help you diagnose when some members are overloaded and overworked, and help you more fairly share the load.\r\n\r\nYour metrics can also help you to reward those team members who are actually contributing to good outcomes and increased client satisfaction, rather than simply rewarding those who appear the busiest and stay in the office latest.\r\n\r\nTechnology isn\u2019t always used in ways that are affirming of workers. It can make their work into a factory line of increasingly alienating and stressful activity. When you instead seek out technology that prioritizes worker well-being, you can pull in dedicated and reliable team members.\r\n<h2>6. Cut down on stress</h2>\r\nStress in the workplace quickly leads to burnout. Some legal work inevitably causes pressure (oral arguments in front of a judge or jury tends to get your adrenaline pumping). But a significant amount of stress in a law office comes from imperfect management techniques and tools.\r\n\r\nCase management software can help you set out clearer and more reasonable workflows for each matter. By carefully laying out the entire workflow, with a chain of deadlines, legal workers won\u2019t have to deal with as many last-minute emergencies.\r\n\r\nAnd with the whole workplace on one clear system, you can cut down on that gnawing sense that you\u2019re missing something.\r\n<h2>7. Improve your clout as a firm</h2>\r\nWorkers are more likely to stay with a firm that seems to be going places. This can look like growing in size and profitability, attracting more prestigious clients, taking on more high-profile and meaningful cases, or reaching a wider community with more affordable legal services.\r\n\r\nAdvanced case management software is one of the tools firms need to grow their power. With tools that improve productivity, enhance client satisfaction, and scale for growth, you can create the kind of firm that the most talented professionals are excited to join.\r\n<h2>8. Keep customizing to fit team preferences</h2>\r\nDon\u2019t just come to your team with a ready-made case management system. Instead, solicit their needs and desires from the beginning in order to find the tools that will most benefit them. Choose a tool that will allow deep customization, so you can continue to meet shifting needs even after implementation.\r\n\r\nBy showing your commitment to address team members\u2019 needs, you\u2019re helping them feel better about a long-term commitment to the firm.\r\n<h2>9. Make new practice areas more accessible</h2>\r\nTo earn the loyalty of talented and ambitious legal professionals, you must provide them opportunities to grow and develop.\r\n\r\nCase management software can support lawyers as they expand into new legal matters and practice areas. As workflows and deadline chains are mapped out, they can have a clearer framework for the steps in the process. This helps take some of the stress out of the learning curve, and helps ensure higher-quality work.\r\n<h2>10. Fight against expectations of 24/7 availability</h2>\r\nFinally, protect your team members\u2019 \u2018off\u2019 hours and vacation days. Just because someone could continue working from anywhere at any time doesn\u2019t mean they always should. One of the biggest stressors from new technologies is from the ways they can disrupt our old work/life balance. Make sure you implement new technologies.\r\n\r\nOnce again, adjusting notification settings in your case management system can help. But also the behavior of leaders plays a huge role in keeping boundaries strong. Leaders must set a strong example by knowing when to go home themselves, refrain from sending messages late in the evening, and keep matters running ahead of deadline so there are fewer last-minute emergencies demanding heroic work efforts.\r\n\r\n_____\r\n\r\nModern legal professionals are facing some big issues right now. But they also have tremendous opportunities for growth and advancement. Case management software can\u2019t solve all possible problems, but it can be a powerful tool in giving workers greater power and satisfaction in their work.\r\n\r\n_______________\r\n\r\n<sup><small>1</small></sup><small>Linda Ouyang, \u201cAnalysis: Attorneys' Well-Being Deficits Need on-the-Job Help,\u201d news.bloomberglaw.com (Bloomberg Law, November 1, 2021), https://news.bloomberglaw.com/environment-and-energy/analysis-attorneys-well-being-deficits-need-on-the-job-help.</small>",

    "social_media_description": "<div title=\"Page 1\">\r\n\r\nPerkins Coie LLP Goes Live with ECFX Notice at Three More Offices as Part of National Rollout\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div title=\"Page 1\">\r\n\r\n<strong>Perkins Coie LLP</strong>\u00a0has deployed ECFX Notice, the leading electronic court filing (ECF) notice solution, in their Chicago, Denver, and Boise offices, the latest in a nationwide rollout of the platform. The Seattle based international law firm with more than 1,200 lawyers provides a full array of corporate, commercial litigation, intellectual property and regulatory legal advice to a broad range of clients. The firm now uses ECFX Notice in ten of their offices, including Seattle, New York, Washington, DC, and Dallas.\r\n\r\n<strong>ECFX Notice</strong>\u00a0is a state-of-the-art SaaS solution that downloads the documents in court notices, distributes the notices and documents directly to the case team, and stores the documents in the appropriate matter or client workspace in any DMS or file system. This process greatly reduces the amount of time required to process court filings, as well as diminishing the associated risk of error from incorrectly filed notices \u2013 giving law firms more control over their documents.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen I first started, I wanted to find a way to streamline the processing of ECFs and get our team out of having to download every notice,\u201d explained Arthur Aguilar, National Docketing Manager at Perkins Coie. \u201cWhen we expanded nationally and did a canvas of the team, each person was spending upwards of two and a half days per week just working in the DMS \u2013 downloading and putting in items, moving them around and renaming them. Now, no human being has to handle the system \u2013 ECFX is running in the background, and does it automatically.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve always believed that taking mundane tasks and automating them is one of the best uses of technology,\u201d commented Dan O\u2019Day, ECFX Co-founder and CEO. \u201cWhen you do things manually, it is costly \u2013 it takes time and it is difficult to have control, because you have to train every staff member to do things the same way, which increases risk.\u201d\r\n\r\nPerkins Coie plans to roll out ECFX Notice to their remaining seven US offices in the coming months. ECFX Notice has them covered because ECFX has taken the approach of partnering with their rapidly growing list of law firm clients to deliver integrations with the courts and third-party\u00a0providers that matter most.\u00a0Following this approach, ECFX has rapidly covered all the major markets including all federal courts and is now focusing on the smaller providers that are important to their clients.\r\n\r\nECFX\r\n\r\nECFX was founded by legal and technology experts with a single goal: to address unmet automation needs in the legal industry. It is committed to filling in the gaps in legal workflows with intelligently automated solutions, enabling firms to save time, gain control, mitigate risk, and improve visibility. Its premier product, ECFX Notice, automates the downloading, profiling, storing, and distribution of court documents in ECF notices for both State and Federal courts\u2014saving your firm hundreds of hours a week to focus on the work your clients value.\r\n\r\n</div>",

The innovative decision, however, also enabled them to dive deeper into IPRO\u2019s capabilities and offerings, resulting in increased productivity, reduced costs, and positive litigation outcomes.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-bordered-circle-with-space\">\r\n<figure class=\"alignright size-large is-resized\"><img class=\"wp-image-67335\" src=\"https://ipro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Segal-McCambridge-logo-square.svg\" alt=\"Segal McCambridge Singer &amp; Mahoney logo\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" /></figure>\r\n</div>\r\nThe 122-attorney \ufb01rm, which has 9 locations in 8 states, was using IPRO eCapture for processing, but chose to migrate their legacy eDiscovery system to a cloud environment with IPRO because of the server capacity and expertise the company provided. As case sizes began to increase, Segal McCambridge took advantage of the power and speed of IPRO's cloud eDiscovery solution, \u2013 and Live EDA and services from IPRO\u2014to scale the solution for their speci\ufb01c needs.\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer is-style-default\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></div>\r\n<h3 id=\"h-easy-to-use-cloud-solution\">Easy to Use Cloud Solution</h3>\r\nThe \ufb01rm unveiled the new cloud platform \ufb01rst to its paralegals who picked it up right away with no additional training. The simple UI and approach to the solution enabled the \ufb01rm to easily extend access to clients or other third parties \u2013 including those who aren\u2019t technology savvy \u2013 who needed to run searches or access data.\r\n<blockquote class=\"c-quotebox\">\r\n<div class=\"ipro-logo-column\"></div>\r\n<p class=\"quote-content\">\"Our partnership with IPRO bolsters our \ufb01rm\u2019s commitment to provide our clients forward thinking technology that can accommodate a full range of eDiscovery needs. We are thrilled to be able to leverage IPRO\u2019s suite of services to provide cost effective, efficient litigation solutions.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"quote-citation\">HENRY LOPEZ, LITIGATION SUPPORT PROJECT MANAGER IN THE FIRM\u2019S CHICAGO OFFICE</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\nBut the power of\u00a0<a href=\"https://ipro.com/products/discovery-enterprise\">discovery ][ Enterprise</a>\u00a0also helped Segal McCambridge better manage large amounts of data in-house, enabling them to search and process 500-600 GB of information for one case so quickly that their attorneys were able to \ufb01le several spoliation motions prior to opposing council processing and reviewing our discovery responses. The speed of our processing directly resulted in the withdrawal of a seven \ufb01gure demand, said Henry Lopez, a Litigation Support Project Manager in the \ufb01rm\u2019s Chicago office.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe cloud has been the right decision for us even before the pandemic, and doing so led to seamless exponential growth during it.\u201d he said. \u201cBecause of IPRO\u2019s cloud infrastructure, we\u2019ve been able to expand our \ufb01rm\u2019s eDiscovery capabilities and provide our clients streamlined, cost-effective, cutting edge legal solutions.\u201d\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer is-style-default\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></div>\r\n<h3 id=\"h-finding-use-cases-for-live-eda\">Finding Use Cases for Live EDA</h3>\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-bordered-circle\">\r\n<figure class=\"alignright size-large\"><img class=\"wp-image-67443\" src=\"https://ipro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Live-EDA-lawyers-165x165-2-copy.png\" alt=\"Lawyers looking at computer\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" /></figure>\r\n</div>\r\nWhen IPRO released Live EDA for its cloud eDiscovery solution,\u00a0Segal McCambridge was eager to \ufb01nd ways to use this new capability to help reduce the amount of ROT (redundant, obsolete and trivial) data that was being transmitted between clients, which was often labor-intensive and costly. After trying Live EDA for one case, they were able to reduce the number of responsive documents from 850,000 to 10,000, allowing the \ufb01rm to reduce attorney document review time, reduce client\u2019s legal spend and expand our legal defense efficiency.\r\n\r\nAs many cases last a year or more, data hosting and transmission fee reductions from Live EDA are going to be a game changer for the \ufb01rm and their clients, Lopez said. \u201cLive EDA is really the way to do this; it\u2019s a proven technology and it works,\u201d he said. \u201cBeing proactive really does set us apart from other mid-size \ufb01rms.\u201d\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer is-style-default\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></div>\r\n<h3 id=\"h-hybrid-in-house-and-outsourced-services\">Hybrid In-House and Outsourced Services</h3>\r\nThough Segal McCambridge has expanded their cloud storage capacity to 35 terabytes, the \ufb01rm occasionally relies on IPRO Services\u2014which also uses the IPRO cloud eDiscovery platform\u2013to process data for its larger cases. The \ufb01rm relies on the hybrid approach when they must process a large amount of data in a short period of time, along with other external reviewers, Lopez said.\r\n\r\nBut they also utilize IPRO Services when their internal reviewers are backed up with other cases and the large dataset requires a specialized skill set to ingest and process, he adds. \u201cOne of the things that working with managed services allowed us to do was accommodate that kind of work\ufb02ow because our environment wasn\u2019t originally set up to handle that kind of data simultaneously,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cWe rely on services to help alleviate that.

The technology provides these organizations with a single, easy-to-use, platform to place data on legal hold across multiple different systems, as well as manage notifications, reminders, and keep tabs on custodians under hold that provides a quick time to value.\r\n\r\nOne of the new financial services Legal Hold customers remarked, \u201cOur current Legal Hold process is entirely manual right now, so using IPRO will save us a lot of time and effort, while at the same time reducing legal risk for us, because our Legal Hold administration will be more accurate.\u201d\r\n\r\nOther new IPRO customers include legal departments across other industries that have chosen the company\u2019s cloud-based eDiscovery solutions, as they seek to bring more processes in house to the reduce costs and risks associated with \u00a0manual processes for eDiscovery.\r\n\r\n\u201cGeneral counsel in legal departments are getting more pressure from their CEOs to reduce costs without increasing risk,\u201d said Dean Brown, CEO, IPRO. \u201cBy tapping into IPRO eDiscovery and Legal Hold, they can equip their attorneys and paralegals with a solution they can easily use without having to be an eDiscovery specialist but provides the industrial strength they need to assess large amounts of data in house without increasing risk or costs.\u201d\r\n\r\nIPRO will showcase the benefits of all its eDiscovery, Legal Hold, and Information Governance solutions at <a href=\"https://www.event.law.com/legalweek\">Legalweek</a> 2022 in New York, March 8-11, at booth 2126.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nRELEASE CONTACT\r\n\r\nBeckie Schuerenberg\r\n\r\npress@iprotech.com\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>About IPRO\u00a0\u2013 www.ipro.com</strong>\r\n\r\nIPRO is reinventing the way organizations interact with their data.

    "short_description": "2022 court technology trends: How access to technology will underpin access to justice",
    "social_media_description": "<h2 class=\"entry-title\">2022 court technology trends: How access to technology will underpin access to justice</h2>\r\nTechnology is already transforming global justice systems and enhancing court processes to ensure the administration of justice is streamlined, efficient, and accessible.\u202fCourts can\u2014and will\u2014take steps in 2022 to build upon this progress, as technological advancement becomes an inevitability rather than a \u2018nice-to-have.\u2019\r\n\r\nHere are some\u202ftrends in court technology that\u202fare predicted to evolve throughout\u202f2022.\r\n\r\n<strong>People-centric justice administration</strong>\r\n\r\nPositioning people at the center of processes and outcomes means courts will work to deliver a justice system that benefits everyone. This demands both an understanding of and a willingness to learn about the specific needs of individuals\u2014be it economic factors,\u00a0digital and general literacy, disability access, language access, attorney access, or self-representation access.\r\n\r\nA one-size-fits-all approach to the administration of justice detrimentally affects\u2014or excludes altogether\u2014people with specific access requirements. There is an opportunity to leverage technology to address established inequalities for court users\u00a0if the notion of courts as a service, rather than a place, underpins the justice system instead.\r\n\r\nPeople-centric justice services are available in a range of formats, are responsive to the individual\u2019s situation, encourage meaningful participation in proceedings, offer clear communication about key details, and provide points of contact for clarification or support. It\u2019s not just about implementing digital tools as a box-ticking exercise to reduce the case backlog statistics, but rather, ensuring the people involved in those cases are supported to overcome any barriers to justice.\r\n\r\n<strong>Addressing the digital divide</strong>\r\n\r\nWhile\u202fvirtual hearings and\u202fdigital court processes, such as online transcript ordering, payments, and e-filing, have\u202fpresented alternative options to in-person hearings and administration,\u202fit is important to factor in the\u202fdigital divide\u2014referring to the factors that influence access to modern technology and tools to aid digital communication and information.\r\n\r\nWhile the intention behind the development of justice technologies is to reduce these barriers, often additional barriers are introduced if they are not developed with diverse user needs in mind.\u00a0One effect of the digitization of court processes is the\u00a0disproportionate benefit for court users who have access to devices, access to adequate internet or mobile data,\u00a0a higher level of digital literacy, or even access to an attorney who can assist them to navigate court processes.\r\n\r\nExpanding\u00a0access to digital tools\u2014such as user-friendly websites, step-by-step guides with accompanying screenshots, or mobile-enabled e-filing tools\u2014for all parties in a dispute ensures a balance between litigants who have attorneys and those who cannot afford them or choose to represent themselves.\r\n\r\nThe funding\u202fallocation from the $1\u202ftrillion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act\u202fis intended to bridge the gap partly and improve\u202fbroadband internet access and affordability across the U.S. However, technological solutions\u202fmust also be carefully integrated with\u202fpeople-centric support\u202fservices to expand access to and usability of digital tools\u2014in addition to simplified non-digital options if required.\r\n\r\nRemote and digital court processes offer great benefits, but courts must be considerate of the digital divide and identify and develop solutions to ensure all court users can meaningfully participate in a digital format.\r\n\r\n<strong>Further leveraging of cloud technology</strong>\r\n\r\nSuccessful court modernization efforts that support all\u00a0court users to\u00a0overcome the\u00a0barriers to justice outlined previously\u00a0will involve cloud-based technologies, such as For The Record\u2019s\u00a0<a href=\"https://content.fortherecord.com/our-solutions/cloud-platform-solutions/\">Cloud Platform Solutions</a>.\u00a0Courts that use cloud technology are able to efficiently and securely\u00a0automate and digitize court processes, increase transparency by providing visibility into valuable court and justice data,\u00a0and\u00a0support equitable\u00a0access to justice.\r\n\r\nWith the focus on people-centric justice, cloud technology designed with diverse user needs in mind\u00a0will continue to help\u00a0courts deliver efficiencies\u00a0to reduce backlogs and processing times, minimize stressful situations for court users, and provide flexible and convenient options through virtual hearings, electronic filing and payments, and digital signatures.\r\n\r\nCollaboration and efficiency are fostered through the secure\u00a0integration of data from different systems\u2014court staff, judges, and attorneys are therefore not bound to on-premises networks to carry out their tasks. By offering scalability, flexibility, and fit-for-purpose options, further adopting cloud technology will reduce IT costs for legacy hardware systems and software licenses, while giving courts access to innovative workflow and security capabilities.\r\n\r\n<strong>Digital court recording helps address stenographic court reporter supply gap</strong>\r\n\r\nDecreased graduation and increased retirement rates for stenographic court reporters across the U.S. point to a significant supply gap that is not being addressed despite a boost in recruitment efforts from the National Court Reporters Association (NCRA) and other organizations. For instance, there were only 36 people that passed the Certified Shorthand Reporters Dictation examination in the state of California in 2021.\r\n\r\nThe growing acceptance and increasing prevalence of digital reporting in the courts, in addition to the implementation of digital recording technologies (such as\u00a0<a href=\"https://content.fortherecord.com/our-solutions/ftr-gold-7/\">FTR Gold</a>)\u00a0in jurisdictions, is addressing the supply gap and supporting the accurate and reliable capture of court proceedings.\r\n\r\nSuccessful\u00a0<a href=\"https://content.fortherecord.com/our-solutions/courtroom-tech/\">courtroom technology, design, and installation</a>\u2014including the hardware and software\u2014leverages sound engineering to deliver clear, natural communication in the physical courtroom and the clearest recordings possible for\u202ftranscript and digital record accuracy.\u00a0Digital court reporters create detailed annotations that are date and time-stamped to the audio recording, while transcribers can isolate\u202fand replay each voice captured on the record and view visual context and cues to aid\u202fcomprehension and transcription\u2014from anywhere, any time.\r\n\r\nAs technology advances, a range of improvements to processes, tools, and staff training ensure the recording is captured and stored as expected. From acoustic design to processing algorithms, redundant recording and backup recorders, to cloud storage and intuitive interfaces and setups, these process improvements and technological innovations work cohesively to address the prevailing criticism of digital recording: inaudible, incomplete, or missing recordings. Furthermore, the schools adding digital reporting and transcription educational programs and the\u00a0American Association of Electronic Reporters and Transcribers\u00a0(AAERT) certification for digital reporters and transcribers\u00a0are elevating the training available for these professions to reach even higher levels of expertise.\r\n\r\nThe innovation that underpins digital court recording technology and the simplicity of the user interface combine with the expertise of the digital court reporter, the court monitor, or a central monitoring team\u2014who ensure the recording system is functioning as expected\u2014to facilitate streamlined proceedings and capture an accurate and complete record. This method also means courts own and are responsible for a digital recording of every detail of the proceeding, rather than relying solely on individuals who bear the responsibility of a typed record.\r\n\r\nA blended model of high-fidelity audiovisual technology, digital court reporting, and traditional court reporting methods is ultimately the best way forward. Digital court reporters represent this mid-point as they utilize high-fidelity, multi-channel recording to capture, monitor, annotate, and transcribe the audio from the proceeding, while providing vital services such as proceeding readback. The digital reporting system enables digital court reporters to confirm or verify their first impressions and ensure a completely verbatim transcript.\r\n\r\nAs such, digital recording hardware and software are deployed to support court reporters to produce accurate and timely court records, support courts when there is difficulty securing stenographers or digital court reporters and support the justice system to deliver on promises of transparency and accessibility.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://content.fortherecord.com/2022-court-technology-trends-how-access-to-technology-will-underpin-access-to-justice/\">2022 court technology trends: How access to technology will underpin access to justice - ForTheRecord</a>",

    "social_media_description": "<h3 class=\"p1\"><b>Security by design</b></h3>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">WiseTime was designed and developed with the principle of individual privacy at the forefront. We believe that individual privacy is paramount, especially as our digital landscapes continue to change and grow. We believe that the software should be designed with privacy and security guiding the way, not as an afterthought.</span></p>\r\n<span class=\"s1\">We take the privacy and security of our customer data very seriously, making continual reviews and updates to ensure that we deliver the highest possible protection. We securely manage data at all touchpoints, protecting your privacy and your data, ensuring proper security regulations, and mitigating risk, which is essential to delivering a high level of service.</span>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">After analysing industry best practices, we identified additional measures that we could adopt to further safeguard our users, by:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">allowing users to determine what activity data is posted to which teams;</span></li>\r\n \t<li class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">storing user activity data in a quasi-anonymized form; and</span></li>\r\n \t<li class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">utilizing an independent federated identity provider.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">With our commitment to customer security and privacy, you can be assured that you and your company are protected with the best practices in privacy and security while using WiseTime.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><b>Infrastructure</b></h3>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">WiseTime utilizes an industry-leading Equinix data center to house our private servers (not shared) containing all WiseTime activity data. Equinix is one of the largest data center providers in the world and their security features an award-winning environment design and is certified in SSAE16/ISAE3402 SOC-1 Type II, ISO 27001 and PCI-DSS. This is the same data center used by Amazon Web Services and the like, which also allows WiseTime to connect to their compute resources privately, shielding their backend processing loads from exposure to any shared public network.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><b>Identity Management</b></h3>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">WiseTime uses the OAuth and SAML Identity management industry standards to provide both secure and flexible mechanisms to prove their identity to the WiseTime service. WiseTime uses Google Firebase for management of identity, which follows industry best practices, such as never storing any user passwords (storing instead a salted hash of it, and that salted hash being stored with a trusted third-party identity provider), and by using revocable device tokens in place of password-based authentication.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">To provide an additional safeguard, WiseTime takes the additional step of storing all activity data (individual and team) in a quasi-anonymous form. That is, the identifying information, such as a user\u2019s name or email address, team names and the like are stored in an independent store to the activity storage.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Our teams and users are instead represented as a large/random number. In the unlikely event of a data breach, any would-be intruders would additionally have to engineer a concurrent heist of our independent federated identity provider, or the data is otherwise unidentifiable. We believe this additional precaution gives our users the strongest safeguards available in the realm of activity analytics.</span></p>\r\n<span class=\"s1\">Our teams and users are instead represented as a large/random number.

For any data transfer to and from the servers, WiseTime uses enforced Transport Layer Security (TLS), to ensure that all communications are sent via a private and secure communications channel.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">File data in transit between WiseTime (currently desktop, mobile, API, or web) and the hosted service is always encrypted via SSL/TLS. For all WiseTime edge points, WiseTime uses current ciphers and certificate standards and forces any unencrypted requests to seamlessly switch to an encrypted channel. Additionally, WiseTime uses token-based authentication cookies to ensure that identifying information connected to the user is never stored on client devices. WiseTime also digitally signs all of their outbound email communications via the DKIM signature standard.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">WiseTime offers an easy-to-use application to help teams collaborate effectively while providing the security measures and compliance certifications organizations require.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><b>Individual privacy</b></h3>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The users right to privacy and full control of their data has always been the driving force behind the way WiseTime was designed and developed. Many other tools openly promote their time tracking software as a way for employers to view exactly what employees are doing at any given time, however, WiseTime is the first of its kind to break this mould.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">We place your data, in your hands, completely and wholly. Nobody can access your data until you choose to share it, and you have the right to amend any time entries, remove or manually add, prior to sharing.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">We have also built preferences into the software that allow you to specify things that you never want WiseTime to track \u2013 such as whenever you are on Facebook, Amazon or reading the news. You can change and update these settings easily and instantly at any time.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><b>Conclusion</b></h3>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">WiseTime\u2019s developer, Practice Insight, takes advantage of their unique capabilities in big data, analytics, and machine learning. Their guiding philosophy has always been to provide transparency, and now even more so than when the company was founded in 2010, this is more important than ever. With our ever-growing individual digital footprints, we need to be informed about the use and storage of the data we share.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Most time tracking solutions may offer some data protection, however, none have been developed with individual privacy and data security at the forefront. WiseTime is the first of its kind to boast individual privacy features, without the ability to be overridden by administrators or managers. Users time logs and data will always be in the control of their hands. We strive to create a solution that makes it easier for users to track their attentions and handle their daily billing and administration, not software that allows others to monitor your activities in real-time or compromise freedoms.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">WiseTime offers the ultimate solution for anyone that values privacy, security, and transparency.</span></p>",

    "social_media_description": "<h4><b>Innovation required</b></h4>\r\n<p class=\"p4\">Driving innovation is critical to just about every business today \u2013 and it\u2019s not just for tech companies. Any industry that makes incremental improvements to products and processes based on expert research and insight actively engages in research and development (R&amp;D). Nevertheless, hiring trained, skilled researchers and supporting them with the time, information and supplies they need can really add up. That\u2019s why it\u2019s an exciting development that recent legislation worldwide has expanded tax credits and advantages for qualified R&amp;D expenditures.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"p3\"><b>A global snapshot</b></h4>\r\n<p class=\"p4\">Companies in more than 40 countries, including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and many others, can take tax credits, super deductions, allowances, cash grants and credits for R&amp;D expenditures.</p>\r\n<img class=\"wp-image-1719 size-full alignright\" src=\"https://wisetime.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/security2-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"521\" height=\"521\" />\r\n<p class=\"p4\">The current US R&amp;D tax credit is a dollar-for-dollar credit against owed or paid federal income taxes. From an IRS tax standpoint, nearly 10 percent of a company\u2019s eligible costs can be applied directly against their federal income tax liability. It even works retroactively. If the company doesn\u2019t pay taxes now, the credits it documents appropriately can be applied to future tax liabilities. On top of this, companies that are involved in R&amp;D can also use these tax credits to increase the return on investment (ROI) they realize for their R&amp;D expenses and increase their market value.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\">In Canada, where federal and provincial corporate statutory tax rates range from 17.5 to 31 percent, companies can receive a tax credit of 20 percent of their expenses related to R&amp;D. Small, private Canadian corporations can get 35 percent credit on the first CAD $3 million in R&amp;D expenses. Credits can be carried ahead for 20 years and back for three.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\">Corporate income in the UK is taxed at a statutory rate of as much as 23 percent. But now the government offers a refundable tax credit of 9.1 percent of all qualifying R&amp;D expenses. It also allows for 100 percent tax depreciation of expenditures on assets used for R&amp;D during the year they were acquired.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\">In Australia, for companies with an aggregated annual turnover of below $20 million, the refundable R&amp;D tax offset will now be a premium of 13.5 percent above the applicant\u2019s company tax rate. From 1 July 2018, for most taxpayers, with a turnover of less than $20 million, the corporate tax rate will be 27.5 percent and the refundable R&amp;D tax offset rate will, therefore, become 41 percent. This is a decrease of 2.5 percent compared to the current refundable R&amp;D tax offset rate for that applicant.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\">Worldwide, governments have significantly expanded permanent tax credits based on corporate revenues and spending on R&amp;D. The potential for companies to reclaim can be in the millions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"p3\"><b>So, how do I get my share?</b></h4>\r\n<p class=\"p4\">Getting this money can be a real challenge. Any expenses you use to apply for R&amp;D tax credits must typically be documented as qualified research expenses (QREs), which are defined as wages, supplies and/or contract research. This includes salaries, a portion of contractor payments, contract research, computer leasing, pay for first-line managers and direct support personnel \u2013 among other things.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\">Clear and accurate accounting for these expenditures is critical, but you\u2019ll need to record them carefully. For example, in the US, as in many other jurisdictions, these expenses must also stand up to a four-part test to make sure they qualify for R&amp;D.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\">The four requirements are:</p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\">Permitted purpose \u2013 The expense is used to develop or improve a product or process for functionality or performance, quality and reliability, or reduce its cost. It\u2019s not permitted if it just improves aesthetics. Process of experimentation \u2013 The expense includes the cost of evaluating alternatives, along with testing and modeling and/or simulations to determine outcomes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"p3\"><b><img class=\"wp-image-1713 size-full alignleft\" src=\"https://wisetime.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/taximages3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"521\" height=\"521\" /></b></h4>\r\n<p class=\"p6\">Process of experimentation \u2013 The expense includes the cost of evaluating alternatives, along with testing and modeling and/or simulations to determine outcomes.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\">Technical uncertainty \u2013 The expense is to test a capability or methodology, deals with an uncertainly in development, an improvement to a product or process, and/or, to determine how to reach specific goals.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p7\">Technological in nature \u2013 Finally, the expense must rely on practices based on solid principles from engineering, physical science, computer science or biological science. It can\u2019t be based on social, economic, psychological sciences \u2013 or guesses \u2013 for its methodology or assumptions.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\">To pass these tests, accounting professionals must document R&amp;D expenses in detail and provide validated tracking on who did the work along with their billable hours. The burden of proof for the tax credit is on the taxpaying company that applies for the rebates. So, you\u2019ll need impeccable records that trace each expense back to its R&amp;D purpose and process.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0\u00a0</span>Of course, you\u2019ll also need a way to repeat this process year after year, so that it becomes a part of your overall business operations \u2013 not a painful and troublesome distraction.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"p3\"><b>The devil in the details</b></h4>\r\n<p class=\"p4\">While corporate accounting firms worldwide see these new tax developments for R&amp;D as good for business, they also pose enormous challenges to the corporations and tax experts who work with them. To qualify R&amp;D expenses, the data collected on them must be accurate, complete and completely audit-proof.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\">At first, it seems inevitable that the process will take a lot of manual effort, but, even that\u2019s not enough. Spreadsheets and self-administered timesheets do not provide sufficient evidence of R&amp;D expenditures to qualify for tax credits. Insufficient or even slightly inaccurate backup data exposes your company to audits, and your accountants to questions about their reputation.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\">To safely navigate the confusing waters of required documentation, companies and their accountants need an accurate, automated, easy-to-implement system that can properly document actual R&amp;D expenses in a way that provides detailed results.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"p3\"><b>The WiseTime difference</b></h4>\r\n<p class=\"p4\">While corporate accounting firms worldwide see these new tax developments for R&amp;D as good for business, they also pose enormous challenges to the corporations and tax experts who work with them.

Automate!</b></h4>\r\n<p class=\"p4\">WiseTime is the world\u2019s first seamless and automatic time tracking software that\u2019s designed to provide all the detail you need without the manual work. It effortlessly and meticulously tracks expenses with categories and annotations you need to properly document the work and expense of R&amp;D without interrupting your current workflow.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"p3\"><b>Start quickly. Protect privacy. Eliminate audits.</b></h4>\r\n<p class=\"p4\">WiseTime tracks across all leading operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. Installing the software on your desktop is easy, too \u2013 just download it and run. As soon as it launches, WiseTime starts documenting time for activities. Users can then view time logs and analytics using the WiseTime Web Console. It works in any enterprise \u2013 including those with highly distributed resources and remote employees.</p>\r\n<img class=\"wp-image-1712 size-full alignright\" src=\"https://wisetime.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/taximages2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"521\" height=\"521\" />\r\n<p class=\"p4\">There\u2019s no time clock to start or stop, and you will never have to fill out a timesheet again. For example, in Microsoft Word, the software records file names in active windows, while the email subject line is used to title activities in Outlook. WiseTime does this seamlessly and passively across all the programs your team uses, including Excel, Adobe tools, PowerPoint, video conferencing platforms, web browsers and many other applications.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\">While the software is designed to be transparent and automatic, users always have full control over the privacy of their tasks and activities. For instance, they can select which specific items reflect work activities before submitting data for timesheets, so recorded time for personal tasks goes no further than their own desktop. You can delete entries and add time logs manually and categorize them any way you like before they\u2019re sent.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\">Nevertheless, even with this manual level of control, employees and users cannot change the time entries automatically collected by WiseTime, so the time and detail it records is always automatically accurate and audit-proof. It provides the right balance of security and privacy for your entire organization.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"p3\"><b>Auto-Tagging for R&amp;D</b></h4>\r\n<p class=\"p4\">Users can fine-tune how WiseTime works to provide detailed insights into the time spent on different tasks and projects using tags. Tags can be added manually to describe each recorded activity by business function \u2013 such as process improvement, product development or research testing. Or alternatively by project, team or location. Users can also easily configure WiseTime to auto-tag activities when certain keywords are mentioned in the material.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\">For instance, consider an organization is working on three research projects\u2014one for product durability, another for ease of use, and another for testing a more economical production material. The product durability team is in one location, but the teams doing the other research are spread across five different facilities worldwide. Tracking their expenses with WiseTime is as easy as using a two-part keyword system wherever the research takes place. Just include a consistent reference to the location and type of research in the tags. WiseTime will do the rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\">This auto-tagging eliminates the need to manually organize any of these recorded tasks and means that you can categorize and account for expenses with granular detail and complete traceability without significant manual effort\u2014even in complex, real-world situations.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\">Tagging also means that you can create audit-proof reports based on any tags or combination of tags or keywords you select, for any period you choose. You can output the data in a PDF format and/or as Excel raw data. In short, WiseTime provides all the flexibility you need to create a wide variety of detailed, audit-proof R&amp;D reports automatically \u2013 with no changes necessary to the way you work now.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"p3\"><b>Conclusion</b></h4>\r\n<p class=\"p4\">Tax laws have changed for R&amp;D expenses across most of the world. Writing on CFO.com, Dean Zerbe, a former senior counsel to the US Senate Finance Committee, said: \u201cCombined together, these modifications to the R&amp;D tax credit have the potential to pump millions back into the economy and bring tremendous value back to small businesses and startups<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0\u00a0</span>\u2013<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0\u00a0</span>the two most important groups when it comes to promoting job creation and economic growth.\u201d</p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\">The drive for innovation is moving faster than ever. Don\u2019t let another tax season go by without discovering how WiseTime can automatically help you recoup R&amp;D dollars and build a better business. It\u2019s your cash.

It's a responsibility we don't take lightly. Your feedback and support have guided us in continually improving our product and identifying use cases we never would have discovered on our own. You're the reason we develop software.\"\r\n\r\nThe AI-powered eBrevia solution is a game-changer for law firms, legal departments, financial institutions, and other legal-adjacent businesses all over the world. With the most precise AI in the industry, eBrevia analyzes and extracts information from contracts, reducing document review times by up to 90% while still increasing accuracy by up to 60%. As a result, eBrevia has experienced impressive growth.\r\n\r\n\"Having been at\u00a0eBrevia\u00a0now for almost 5 years, I've had the joy and fortune of seeing the company grow,\" said\u00a0Preethy\u00a0Prakash, VP of Business Development. \"From a true startup, working out of a\u00a0WeWork\u00a0office, to becoming a full-fledged company and a part of a renowned public company, Donnelley Financial.\"\r\n\r\nThe International Legal Technology Association hosts the Distinguished Peer Awards each year. They aim to honor individuals and business partners who have demonstrated exceptional accomplishments within ILTA member law firms or departments.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the \"Solution Provider of the Year Award\" recognizes one ILTA business partner for their outstanding achievements and exceptional advancement of a software or technology solution.\r\n\r\nThe winner of this prestigious award must fulfill multiple strict criteria to be considered. These include: developing a solution applicable to the legal tech space, showing that legal departments/law firms are using this solution, fostering a continued culture of innovation, and \u2013 perhaps most importantly \u2013 they must provide incredible customer service.\r\n\r\neBrevia doesn't just check those boxes, it raises the bar. This award is more evidence that the world's law and law-adjacent industries are starting to realize the extreme versatility and scalability that AI can provide.

The parties make any changes to the Cloud Terms by cover page and attachments,\r\nsimplifying and shortening the negotiation process. The open source nature of the agreement\r\n(released for free under CC BY) makes it easy to implement and the use of standard terms\r\nallows legal teams to focus on what really matters and restores goodwill back to the process for\r\nboth parties.\r\n\r\nCoinciding with this launch, <a href=\"https://bonterms.com/about/\">Chris Walker</a>, an enterprise software veteran, joins the company as\r\nCo-Founder and Head of Product. Chris will drive the company\u2019s product direction and build out\r\nBonterms\u2019 Negotiation as a Service Platform.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhile we\u2019re part of a larger open legal wave, we\u2019re also heading in our own direction and\r\ndeveloping a Negotiation as a Service Platform,\u201d said Chris Walker. \u201cOur software vision is to\r\noffer a new approach to negotiating SaaS deals, one that preserves good will from the start and\r\nallows the parties to focus on what they really care about in the negotiation.\u201d\r\nBonterms also announced its seed funding by <a href=\"https://www.xyz.vc/\">XYZ</a> and select angel investors in the technology\r\nand legal sectors. The company will debut at <a href=\"https://www.event.law.com/legalweek?utm_source=ppc&amp;utm_medium=google&amp;utm_campaign=legalweek&amp;utm_content=searchads&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiApL2QBhC8ARIsAGMm-KFk7WhgdcIli0x1joAMUX1NQ8stA9P5Xj6ZMS4IbuJT5loLdnILuM8aAohLEALw_wcB\">LegalWeek</a> in New York March 9 \u2013 11, and Todd Smithline will be a featured speaker at the <a href=\"https://app.glueup.com/event/legaltech-in-5d-47047/\">LegalTech in 5D\u00a0Salon</a>, hosted by Doon Insights on\r\nMarch 23.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://bonterms.com/about/\">Todd Smithline</a> has nearly 30 years experience designing, negotiating and teaching contracts.\r\nHe was General Counsel of Marimba, a publicly traded technology company, and the founder of\r\nSmithline PC, a boutique technology firm that pioneered fixed-free subscription billing.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://bonterms.com/about/\">Chris Walker</a> has over a decade of experience in enterprise software and has held product\r\nleadership roles for category leading companies such as Palantir Technologies, DataFox,\r\nOracle and DraftWise.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://bonterms.com/\">Bonterms</a> is a privately held company focused on simplifying commercial contracting by\r\nproviding best-practice, balanced, open source legal forms for the enterprise.\r\n\r\nFebruary 24, 2022\r\n\r\nMedia Contact: Liz Westover | marketing@bonterms.com | 415.834.1700\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.theedgeroom.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Bonterms-LegalWeek-Release-2022-02-24-FNL.docx.pdf\">Click for PDF</a>.",

Further, silent hold capabilities allow legal teams to easily enact holds, without the need to engage IT departments to ensure retention of sensitive information. The easy-to-deploy solutions and workflow allow corporate legal teams to save time and resources and improve their compliance with state and federal laws.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cThe legal hold product team that is joining DISCO has built modern, complete solutions for the legal workflow needs of today, complementing DISCO\u2019s solutions that empower legal departments to focus on delivering better legal outcomes,\u201d said DISCO Chief Product Officer Kevin Smith. \u201cWe are excited to further demonstrate how great technology can empower legal teams, save time and money, increase efficiency, and ensure compliance. This also addresses the unmet needs of our legal services partners, many of whom have relied on legacy services to fill this critical gap for their customers.\u201d</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cWhen you look at the legal technology market, there are few companies that have enough disruptive DNA to upset the status quo.

Their principal practice management system is Inprotech, by CPA Global.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When we approached Spruson &amp; Ferguson with our proposal to pilot WiseTime, they were interested to see whether the system could increase the efficiency and reduce the administrative burden of timekeeping.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>The requirements of the pilot</b></span></h4>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">One of the key considerations of the pilot was the amount of work required from Spruson &amp; Ferguson\u2018s internal resources to configure WiseTime and whether it would have any effect on their existing platforms or processes. It was important that any new system was complementary to, and compatible with, their existing set up.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">WiseTime is designed to connect easily to existing systems. Therefore, there were no larger implications for existing systems or procedures at Spruson &amp; Ferguson. The WiseTime Connector is easily configured by our team and then works alongside Inprotech and in conjunction with the existing timekeeping method.</span></p>\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-1726 alignright\" src=\"https://wisetime.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/spruson2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"521\" height=\"521\" />\r\n<h4 class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Testing WiseTime against the start-stop time clock</b></span></h4>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Spruson &amp; Ferguson\u2019s existing method of time capture utilised the built-in timekeeping system that is included as part of their current practice management system. This includes a start-stop timer, as well as the option to manually add activity. For both options, the attorney must look up the case matter and then manually input the information about the task to add it to the client file for billing.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">When using the start-stop timer, attorneys must start a new timer whenever their attention is diverted to anything outside of that specific case matter, such as when receiving a phone call, or on receipt of an urgent email. They must either stop the timer on the first matter and switch to paper notes for later entry, or they must look up the new matter that their attention has shifted to before beginning.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">This method is not highly efficient. Further, many attorneys resort to a paper-ledger as a backup, in case they forget to stop or start the timer on a given matter, creating a subsequent manual task of transcribing the paper notes.\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">During the pilot, Spruson &amp; Ferguson attorneys used WiseTime to autonomously capture their work time in the background, while still continuing to use their existing start-stop and manual method. This enabled us to get an accurate comparison of the time captured and the time spent on administration for each method.\u00a0</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"p3\"><b>Easy connection to your practice management system</b></h4>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Spruson &amp; Ferguson used the WiseTime Connector to connect to Inprotech. Once connected, WiseTime can detect the matter references from Inprotech and will automatically tag activities when a keyword match for each matter reference is identified. This means that any work performed on a document containing the reference number in the subject line, window title or document title is captured and seamlessly assigned to the correct case and client.</span></p>\r\n<span class=\"s1\">Connecting to your existing systems might sound like a large project with a lengthy timeline \u2013 this is not the case with WiseTime Connector. We\u2019ve designed WiseTime to connect in a lightweight and non-intrusive manner, relying on read-only access for the majority of its functionality.</span>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"s1\">There are only two things WiseTime requires to fully connect:</span>\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li><span class=\"s1\">Detect when a new case is added to your system</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span class=\"s1\">Know where to send your WiseTime data when users post it</span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<span class=\"s1\">Once the connector is enabled, the time information will flow directly into the relevant fields of your existing system.</span>\r\n<h4 class=\"p3\"><b>The pilot group</b></h4>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The Spruson &amp; Ferguson pilot consisted of a small group of users over a period of two weeks. Users kept WiseTime running in the background but continued to use their current timekeeping system as per usual. WiseTime was autonomously recording the time the attorneys worked on their cases while the attorneys also recorded their time manually so that an accurate analysis was possible.\u00a0</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">To calculate the average amount of time spent curating and posting the time data from WiseTime, we used later data from users after they had switched to solely using WiseTime.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>The pilot results speak for themselves</b></span></h4>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The per week averages of the pilot group were as follows:</span></p>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1113 size-full\" src=\"https://wisetime.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/WiseTime-Spruson-768x121-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"121\" />\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">While the results were stronger than anticipated, it is important to note that the above hourly figures do not necessarily represent billed hours, but rather the number of hours of time and attention information that were submitted to case-related matters. The pilot group perform a variety of fixed-fee work items, which in the past had not been recorded with their manual timekeeping method. With WiseTime, the team was also able to effortlessly capture the time spent on fixed-fee work. This additional information was captured with no extra burden on the user and could be used as supporting information for billing reports or as internal record keeping for fixed-fee work.</span></p>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1114\" src=\"https://wisetime.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Final-Pilot-Results-Graph-768x269-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"269\" />\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><b>In summary, using WiseTime, the pilot team doubled the hours they documented, captured and accounted for in half the time it would take to manually do so.\u00a0</b></p>\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Increased efficiency and transparency</b></span></h4>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The Spruson &amp; Ferguson pilot demonstrates the increased efficiencies that can be gained with WiseTime. As well as reducing the administrative burden of timekeeping, WiseTime increases the level of detail captured for tasks throughout the day with no additional effort from the user.\u00a0</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">By sharing additional time and attention data, your clients can gain a deeper understanding of the effort you have directed to their matter, and a greater appreciation as to the value of the service provided. In addition, you may decide to utilise the additional information to provide more detailed invoices to clients.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">One of the key advantages of WiseTime is its flexible implementation options. Spruson &amp; Ferguson gave their attorneys the option to use both time-keeping tools.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Spruson &amp; Ferguson was very pleased with the results from the pilot and is now planning to expand its use of WiseTime. As the firm expands its use, it expects to see considerable reductions in timekeeping administration work, paired with the increased efficiencies and timekeeping accuracy that the platform provides.</span></p>",

    "social_media_description": "<h3><a href=\"https://wisetime.com/a-matter-of-time-keeping-track-of-work-with-wisetime/\">How workplace time is spent</a></h3>\r\nToday\u2019s knowledge workers, such as accountants, lawyers, digital consultants and product developers, are masters of multitasking. Even if they\u2019re working on just a single project or account, they\u2019re likely to be jumping from one desktop task to another over the typical workday. Websites. Word documents.\r\n\r\nSpreadsheets. Emails. PDFs. PowerPoints and more. And chances are good they\u2019re working on more than one project or account at a time.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-1702 alignright\" src=\"https://wisetime.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/matteroftime4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"521\" height=\"521\" />\r\n<h3>The time-tracking challenge</h3>\r\nThat makes it hard to track every minute spent on every task. But not tracking time isn\u2019t an option, especially in businesses where work is billed by the hour or even the minute. And organizations that don\u2019t bill in this way still need to keep an eye on time to understand how different departments, sites and project teams are working.\r\n\r\nIdeally, that means finding a way to track time that\u2019s easy, smart and autonomous, that doesn\u2019t require manual starts and stops. Ideal solutions, though, are hard to come by. While there are hundreds upon hundreds of timekeeping systems on the market, most don\u2019t meet all of these needs.\r\n<h3>What makes WiseTime unique</h3>\r\nWhat\u2019s different about WiseTime is that it\u2019s easy because it integrates with most of the workflow software found in your typical office. It\u2019s smart, with analytics that provide valuable insights into your most important projects and clients.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s also autonomous, which means it works unobtrusively in the background as you work, without you ever having to remember to click \u2018start\u2019 or \u2018stop\u2019. And it gives you flexibility and control, so you can add tasks manually when needed and avoid sharing data around private activities not related to work.\r\n<h3>What benefits does WiseTime deliver?</h3>\r\nWhat does that mean for you? It means you no longer have to worry about how many billable hours you might be missing because you don\u2019t always remember to track them. It means you have a way to see how efficient and productive different parts of the organisation are. It also means you can focus on your work without interrupting your flow for timekeeping. And it means you can understand better than ever exactly how time use contributes to your bottom line.\r\n<h3>Time management challenges \u2013 changing concepts of work and work time</h3>\r\nIn today\u2019s \u2018Fourth Industrial Revolution\u2019 work is dramatically different from what it was in the past. Technology has played a major role in this revolution: computers, the Internet, wireless communication, mobile computing, digitalization, advances in artificial intelligence and more. So too have globalisation and new concepts about how to work.\r\n\r\nFor today\u2019s workers, especially those in professional services and knowledge-based industries, these changes have brought new ways of measuring productivity. Businesses want to understand what they\u2019re spending time on, and how those tasks contribute to the bottom line. And business customers, particularly those billed by the hour, want to know they\u2019re getting the services they paid for.\r\n\r\nThis means tracking the time spent on myriad tasks each day, across many different applications and for many different clients. But as the work itself grows ever more complex, so does the challenge of tracking it as accurately, easily and unobtrusively as possible. Finding a solution that does all of these things isn\u2019t easy.\r\n<h3>Manual time tracking</h3>\r\nOne way to track time involves trying to remember later how many minutes and hours were spent on each task, and writing that down. While that seems both easy and unobtrusive, it\u2019s usually far from accurate.\r\n\r\nThe longer the span between completing work and noting the time spent on it, the less accurate the record is likely to be. Your recollection of how long you spent on each project might not be bad at the end of one day, but after a week or a month, your memory might be little better than pure guesswork.\r\n\r\nThe problem? Workers are likely to end up undercounting the time spent on work. And that means your business ends up under-billing for the amount of work actually done. Or you don\u2019t get a clear picture of how productive/efficient your workforce is. And if you don\u2019t understand how much time has been spent on different projects, it\u2019s hard to plan properly for the future or prepare accurate financial forecasts.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-1703 alignleft\" src=\"https://wisetime.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/matteroftime2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"521\" height=\"521\" />\r\n<h3>Time-tracking software</h3>\r\nThe alternative for many organisations today is time-tracking software. The concept is simple enough: workers hit the software\u2019s \u2018start\u2019 button whenever they begin a task, then click \u2018stop\u2019 when they\u2019re finished or need to take a break.\r\n\r\nAccuracy is typically not an issue with this approach. But ease of use and obtrusiveness are.\r\n\r\nImagine, for example, that you\u2019re about to wrap up three big projects and need to keep track of how much time you spend on each during the final day. You start by reading, writing and sending several emails for Client A, remembering to click \u2018start\u2019 before opening your email client. While going through messages, though, you see that Client B has an urgent question that needs answering, and Client C has emailed some last-minute additions for a report due by the end of the day.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, your time-tracking efforts have become a lot more complicated. Do you continue on to the next task for Client A, ignoring the emails from Clients B and C for now? Or do you click \u2018stop\u2019 for one client, start a new time-tracking session for Client B\u2019s emails and then, once you\u2019ve finished with those, stop and start a third time for Client C?\r\n\r\nFaced with this conundrum, some people might decide to forego time tracking for Client B\u2019s and C\u2019s emails altogether. While that might seem easiest, the result again is undercounted time and under- billed work.\r\n<h3>Insights gained\u2026 or lost</h3>\r\nWith more accurately tracked data about time spent on different projects, businesses can also gain new insights into things beyond billing alone. For instance, knowing which clients are most time- intensive \u2013 and whether that time is worth the revenue generated \u2013 can help companies make better decisions about future marketing, contracts and hires. Understanding how time relates to costs and earnings can also help a business create smarter budgets and project schedules.\r\n\r\nWorkers themselves can benefit as well. More detailed data about who does what, for example, can prove that the one telecommuter on a key project team contributes just as much as \u2013 if not more than \u2013 the in-house staffers. More accurate information about work done and projects accomplished can also provide validation for workers seeking better feedback on the job.\r\n<h3>Seamless operation</h3>\r\nAny business looking for timekeeping software will find hundreds of different solutions to choose from, with a mind-boggling array of options and capabilities. However, WiseTime is unlike any other solution on the market.\r\n\r\nFirst, it\u2019s seamless and autonomous. There\u2019s no need to remember to hit \u2018start\u2019 or \u2018stop\u2019: WiseTime simply works in the background while you work, tracking desktop apps and activities. Whatever you\u2019re doing, WiseTime auto-tags tasks either automatically or according to user-specified rules. Tags can describe tasks by keywords, matter IDs, document IDs or purpose (for example, \u201csales\u201d or \u201cmarketing\u201d), allowing users to see later how much time they\u2019ve spent on specific tasks, projects or clients.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s also room to add in offline activities manually, ensuring no worktime goes unrecorded. A pop-up prompt in the WiseTime app offers regular reminders to include offline activities.\r\n<h3>Easy integration</h3>\r\nSecond, WiseTime integrates easily into your existing workflow and connects to the systems that you are already using. It also works across all of the leading operating systems, such as Windows, Mac OS and Linux.\r\n\r\nInstalling the WiseTime desktop application is simple and straightforward. As soon as it is installed, it starts collating your time for activities and sends that data to the WiseTime Console. Your time information is analysed instantaneously in the WiseTime Console, and you can then view the time entries and analytics via the Console.\r\n\r\nWiseTime identifies a user\u2019s different activities by taking key information from the applications a user actively works in during a work session. For example, in Microsoft Word, the software will use the document name, while for an email the subject line is used to identify the activity. WiseTime does this across all programs including Excel, Adobe, PowerPoint, video conferencing, web browsers and others.\r\n\r\nIn addition, WiseTime Enterprise users can integrate WiseTime with some of the world\u2019s most popular project, finance or software management programs they might be using. Large organisations can also simplify deployment across departments or the entire business by connecting up their user directories (Active Directory or LDAP). The WiseTime Agent allows the system to be run in a virtualised enterprise environment.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-1705 alignright\" src=\"https://wisetime.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/matteroftime3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"521\" height=\"521\" />\r\n<h3>Insights through auto-tagging, analytics</h3>\r\nFinally, users can fine-tune how WiseTime works to gain even more detailed insights into the time spent on different tasks and projects. Tags can be added manually to describe each recorded activity by business function\u2014such as marketing, development, recruitment, office management, etc.\u2014or by project, team or location. Users can also set keywords to enable WiseTime to auto-tag activities when certain they are mentioned. For example, a user could specify a tag for all activities that mention \u201cxero\u201d or mark any activity with the word \u201cinvoice\u201d with the tag \u201caccounting.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor organisations using the WiseTime Enterprise Plan that have connected WiseTime with a practice management system, auto-tagging takes place in the background almost magically when case references are identified. For instance, whenever a user works on a document that refers to a client or project matter number, the activity is auto-tagged with the project or client code, and can later be synced to the appropriate program. Such auto-tagging eliminates the need to manually organise recorded tasks later. Users can set up tags and rules to specify what should be tagged and how and can also manually tag tasks with specific project names, numbers, etc.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s important to note that users always retain full control over the privacy of their tasks and activities. For instance, they can select which specific items reflect work activities before submitting data for timesheets, so recorded time for personal tasks goes no further than their own desktop.\r\n\r\nWiseTime\u2019s analytics capabilities also make it simple to sort and graph recorded activities in a number of ways, allowing users to view how they work by hour, by day, by tag or by application. Such graphs help provide a visual sense of how they spend their time. This can help identify which tasks and activities are most time-intensive \u2013 or lucrative \u2013 opening up opportunities for improved business decisions down the road. These analytics tools work for individuals as well as for managers looking at activities across an entire workforce.\r\n<h3>WiseTime in action</h3>\r\nSo how do all of these capabilities translate into real-world business benefits? A large Australian law firm specialising in intellectual property rights recently put WiseTime to the test, putting it through a two-phase trial over the course of seven months.\r\n<h3>Company challenges</h3>\r\nLike many businesses, the law firm didn\u2019t have a firm grasp before starting the trial on how much billable time it might have been missing due to its timekeeping limitations. And its attorneys often found themselves spending far too much time and energy manually logging each work-related activity or writing off small-time increments spent on responding to client emails. This not only interrupted their workflow, it meant less time spent on actual client-related tasks.\r\n<h3>From small pilot to wider implementation</h3>\r\nBecause the law firm wanted to ensure that the WiseTime integration would be as user-friendly and intuitive as possible, it started small. The solution was trialed with five attorneys, allowing them to take the system for a test run over the course of four months during live product development. The initial goal was to see how WiseTime would fit into the firm\u2019s daily work routines, with a focus on how easy and intuitive it was for attorneys to use.\r\n\r\nAfter that, the law firm expanded into a second phase, during which 15 lawyers tried out WiseTime for three months. In this part of the trial, the business was looking for signs of more concrete benefits, such as increases in billable times or productivity.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-1704 alignleft\" src=\"https://wisetime.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/matteroftime.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"521\" height=\"521\" />\r\n<h3>Results and benefits</h3>\r\nAfter seven months of testing, the results showed a clear benefit to the law firm\u2019s bottom line. On average, attorneys using WiseTime each submitted 1.5 hours more per week to billing compared to previous months in which they had recorded time in traditional ways. While that amount of time might at first seem insignificant, the long-term return for a large firm is considerable.\r\n\r\nFor instance, just one extra hour of billable time per lawyer each week could \u2013 over the course of one year \u2013 mean increased revenues of up to $2 million or more for a law firm with 100 lawyers.\r\n\r\nFor the attorneys in Australia who tested WiseTime, the intangible benefits were also meaningful. One attorney noted that the WiseTime statistics showing time spent on each program made it much easier to understand how much work went into simply responding to client emails every day. And he was astounded to see how a few more billable minutes for each email amounted to a substantial increase of billable time, enabling him to better hit targets by the end of the month.\r\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\r\nThere are many timekeeping tools available, but WiseTime comes to this market with unique capabilities in big data, analytics, and machine learning. Its guiding philosophy since it was founded in 2010 is to build software that makes people\u2019s lives easier.\r\n\r\nTimekeeping is an area where, until now, many solutions have been accurate and efficient, but not necessarily easy, smart, automatic and fair. WiseTime\u2019s ability to work seamlessly and automatically in the background makes it different from numerous alternatives.\r\n\r\nUnlike many other timekeeping systems, WiseTime provides users with privacy and control: it doesn\u2019t \u2018spy\u2019 on workers or indiscriminately grab every bit of task and activity data. For example, if you just quickly checked the status of your eBay auction, or Googled a recipe, your employer doesn\u2019t need to know.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, employers and clients gain a new level of transparency into the time spent on the work they\u2019re paying for. They can also gain new insights to help them improve processes, minimise pain points and increase revenues into the future. Such capabilities are critical in today\u2019s business world when existing competitors and start-up rivals alike are continually looking for new strategies and digital technologies to give them an advantage.\r\n\r\nWant to learn more about what WiseTime can do for you? Whether you\u2019re an individual freelancer, a small business or a large global enterprise, we\u2019re ready to answer your questions and help you get started with a WiseTime plan that\u2019s right for you.",

    "social_media_description": "<strong><em>Partnership Integrates AI Tools with Mitratech\u2019s TeamConnect</em></strong>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Today, WiseTime announced a new strategic partnership with Mitratech to enhance efficiency and relieve administrative burdens for professionals. As legal leaders are working to manage workloads, address WFH burnout, and deal with the great resignation trend, the Mitratech community will have a comprehensive tool at hand. WiseTime provides a time and productivity tracking tool that eliminates the burden of manual data entry while also resolving individual privacy concerns.\u00a0</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">WiseTime and Mitratech began their collaboration during an implementation project at a state agency, where Mitratech\u2019s TeamConnect software is employed to manage the state\u2019s legal matters. While developing the connection between the software tools, the two companies saw potential to assist clients in a similar manner and to expand the collaboration into additional products and business areas.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">WiseTime has developed a software suite that seamlessly integrates the autonomous and AI driven capabilities of WiseTime\u2019s time and productivity tracking tool with Mitratech\u2019s TeamConnect.

if contract intelligence engines built upon a foundation of machine learning are fed a nutritious diet of relevant\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.cobblestonesoftware.com/blog/safeguarding-data-with-contract-management-software\">contract data</a>.\r\n\r\n<strong>How AI is Changing Contract Management</strong>\r\n\r\n<em>Cast aside apocalyptic visions of malevolent androids.</em>\u00a0 Artificial intelligence in contract management is designed to enable contract professionals to focus on strategizing and making informed decisions with an enhanced understanding of\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.cobblestonesoftware.com/blog/establishing-a-more-robust-risk-response-plan\">contract risk</a>\u00a0and the positive and negative relationships between data, contract language, and contract processes.\r\n\r\nDo not worry; contract AI cannot\u00a0replace contract management professionals; instead, it is designed to streamline data insertion, data extraction, data protection measures, and risk identification tasks with automated data entry and risk assessment mapping.\u00a0 AI-powered contract management software transforms static contract documents and contract data into dynamic building blocks that contract management professionals need for improved contract oversight, proactive opportunity identification, and risk mitigation.\r\n\r\n<strong>Artificial Intelligence and Agreement Data</strong>\r\n\r\nContract management artificial intelligence users can select specific data points and configure rules based on contract types.\u00a0 This intelligent contract management software functionality is helpful because data is consolidated and easily digestible, allowing users to set rules regarding locations, dates, monetary values, personally identifiable information (PII), payment card information (PCI), and other subsets of key data for a given contract.\u00a0 Once configured, these processes are automated by contract intelligence - reducing the time wasted on tedious data import analysis so more time can be spent making\u00a0<strong><a href=\"https://www.cobblestonesoftware.com/blog/5-critical-decisions-driven-by-contract-data\">data-driven decisions.</a></strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>AI for Term, Clause, and Contract Data Extraction</strong>\r\n\r\nAI-powered contract management software\u00a0is a key player in data extraction functionality.\u00a0\u00a0<strong><a href=\"https://www.cobblestonesoftware.com/blog/5-reasons-to-choose-contract-data-extraction-services\">Data extraction</a></strong>\u00a0tools can also be beneficial to organizations that manage legacy contracts.\u00a0 If an organization has legacy agreements that need importing into contract management software but does not have a structured data spreadsheet with which to perform a bulk data import, said bulk data can be systematically extracted so that users do not have to manually key in individual fields.\u00a0 Consequently, contract clauses, contract terms, and contract data input are streamlined - providing the visibility and ease-of-use necessary to search, report, compare, and classify contracts and legal risks.\r\n\r\n<strong>Contract Artificial Intelligence Streamlines Contract Workflows</strong>\r\n\r\nIn the interest of minimizing wasted time and money resulting from inefficient contract workflows, contract administrators should take note of the time frame in which individual tasks are completed, as well as which tasks are causing delays and prolonging cycle times.\u00a0 Reliable, AI-powered contract management software provides\u00a0<strong><a href=\"https://www.cobblestonesoftware.com/contract-management-software/contract-workflows\">intelligent workflow automation</a></strong>\u00a0that supports task performance monitoring.\u00a0 Contract managers can identify the number of days it took employees to complete assigned tasks, promoting accountability.\u00a0 From there, tasks can be quickly escalated to increase timeliness and keep the contract lifecycle moving.\r\n\r\nIn addition to ensuring task deadlines are met, contract management professionals armed with contract AI can easily keeps tabs on the number of days a given contract is sitting in each status or stage of the contract lifecycle.\u00a0 Visibility can drastically increase with easy-to-understand visual representations of\u00a0<strong><a href=\"https://www.cobblestonesoftware.com/blog/contract-analytics-reporting-mastery\">workflow analytics and reports</a></strong>.\u00a0 Consequently, bottlenecks in the workflow process can be easily identified so inefficient contract lifecycle management practices can be eliminated.\r\n\r\nWith newfound insight into why their contracts are being delayed, contract managers can reassign roles, rotate task assignments, or escalate tasks - \u00a0evolving their\u00a0<strong><a href=\"https://www.cobblestonesoftware.com/blog/what-is-contract-lifecycle-management\">contract lifecycle management</a></strong>\u00a0practices accordingly.\r\n\r\n<strong>More Accountability with AI-Based Contract Management</strong>\r\n\r\nProper\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.cobblestonesoftware.com/blog/assessing-contract-risk-early-identification-and-prevention\"><strong>risk management</strong></a>\u00a0is crucial in successful contract management.\u00a0 AI-powered contract management software makes risk analysis, risk assessment, and risk mitigation easy and efficient.\u00a0 Contract Management AI encourages robust risk mitigation by allowing users to fully leverage the features and functionality made available to them by their contract management software (such as tracking of counterparties, workflows, employees, tasks, records, etc.).\r\n\r\nA risk score can be provided to users based on their usage of available tools.\u00a0 This feature holds contract management professionals accountable for how fastidiously they utilize tools to prevent risk.\r\n\r\nFor example, if Sally's organization's intelligent contract management software reveals to her that it is not putting enough time into tracking approval status, then the organization adjusts how it tracks approvals accordingly so that it is allocating the necessary effort to mitigate risks associated with counterparty activity.\u00a0 When contract management AI solutions establish checks and balances, risk mitigation practices are improved, and risk is reduced - streamlining the risk prevention process and minimizing losses.\r\n\r\n<strong>Contract Management and Risk Assessment</strong>\r\n\r\nContract management AI can provide further insight into contract risk with risk rating and mapping features.\u00a0 Contract risk profile ratings allow contract managers to visualize risk variables.\u00a0 Based on the tracking of risk, an AI-powered contract management software can provide a\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.cobblestonesoftware.com/blog/how-to-use-a-contract-management-risk-and-opportunity-assessment-tool\">risk assessment matrix</a>.\r\n\r\nNot only can users see risk probability patterns for events within contracts, but they can also see the\u00a0<em>exposure\u00a0</em>that results from those contract risks.\u00a0 Insight into possible detrimental consequences of an event with potential risk can help contract managers decide how to proceed with a given contract.\u00a0 Visualizing the results of an action associated with risk inherently reduces risk and allows contract managers to move forward with risk management decisions quicker and more efficiently.\r\n\r\n<strong>Artificial Intelligence in Contract Lifecycle Management</strong>\r\n\r\nContract management professionals need to make sure they are powered with the tools above so that they can prepare for better contract visibility and reduced risk.\u00a0 As such they should leverage the only solution on the market that offers all of these tools and more: CobbleStone\u00ae.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.cobblestonesoftware.com/products/enterprise-contract-management-software\">CobbleStone Contract Insight<sup>\u00ae</sup></a>\u00a0is an advanced contract lifecycle management software backed by\u00a0artificial intelligence\u00a0that allows contract managers to manage, track, and draft contracts faster, and automate and streamline the entire contract lifecycle with flexible features such as contract authoring, workflow, version tracking, and so much more.\r\n\r\nDiscover why\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.cobblestonesoftware.com/resources/contract-software-case-studies\"><strong>thousands of contract managers</strong></a>\u00a0trust CobbleStone Software with their contract management needs.\u00a0 To learn more about CobbleStone\u2019s unparalleled contract management software, book a\u00a0<a href=\"https://hubs.li/H0CGps40\"><strong>free demo</strong></a>\u00a0with a Contract Insight expert today!\r\n\r\n<em>To stay up to date on best practices, industry news, and CobbleStone Software updates, be sure to subscribe to our\u00a0</em><a href=\"https://www.cobblestonesoftware.com/blog\"><strong><em>blog</em></strong></a><em>\u00a0and\u00a0</em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/cobblestonesoftware\"><strong><em>YouTube Channel</em></strong></a><em>.</em>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

    "short_description": "Press release: Onna Announces In-place Preservation for eDiscovery",
    "social_media_description": "<b>New York and Barcelona </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u2014 8 March, 2022: </span><a href=\"http://www.onna.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Onna</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, the knowledge discovery leader, today announced the availability of Onna eDiscovery In-place Preservation. Through a single action from within Onna, the In-place Preservation feature </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">deploys data preservation in real-time </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">across content, communication, and collaboration applications, helping legal teams improve the efficiency and reduce the risk of the legal hold process.\u00a0</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">While Onna eDiscovery customers have always been able to preserve their data within Onna's centralized and search-ready archive, In-place Preservation offers customers the additional choice to preserve data within the source application.\u00a0</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In today\u2019s remote working world, placing and managing in-app legal holds and preservations has become an increasingly complex challenge, often involving many custodians and a variety of file types stored across multiple cloud applications. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Having to apply and manage legal holds separately across numerous applications </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">requires more time, which puts data at risk of being deleted or changed during the process. It also increases the likelihood that key custodians are placed on hold incorrectly or missed entirely. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Failing to adequately preserve data can result in substantial consequences, from financial penalties to negative inference, which can adversely impact case outcomes.\u00a0</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Onna eDiscovery In-place Preservation simplifies and reduces risk in the legal hold process by allowing IT or legal departments to simply upload a list of targeted custodians into Onna eDiscovery, select their applications, and execute preservations across each of those applications in a single action. Key benefits include:</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Efficiency</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">: Reduce manual work and save time by unifying the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">legal hold and preservation process for all applications and targeted custodians into a single step</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0</span></li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Real-time holds</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">: Placing holds in real time gives legal teams time to validate which custodians are relevant to their case prior to a collection\u00a0</span></li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Centralized management</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">: Preserve data once and manage holds easily from a centralized location</span></li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Expedited downstream collections</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">: Users have peace of mind knowing that subsequent collections will be efficient and defensible \u2013\u2013\u00a0once In-place Preservation is completed, users will be able to search, cull, and export the resulting data set to their review tool for further analysis</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cTwo of the biggest concerns attorneys have with using technology to preserve targeted data is the lack of consistency in the execution of preservation across all applications, and the lack of trust that all data has been adequately preserved within those applications,\u201d said Jose Lazares, Chief Product Officer at Onna. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\"By enabling data preservation both in Onna and in source systems with a single click, we are providing that consistency and enabling a legal hold process that attorneys can trust. \"</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Onna eDiscovery In-place Preservation will support Slack and Google Vault preservation tasks to start, with Microsoft Office 365 and Box soon to follow.\u00a0</span>\r\n\r\nYou can view the press release online here: https://onna.com/blog/onna-announces-in-place-preservation-for-ediscovery/\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u2013\u2013\u00a0ends \u2013\u2013</span>\r\n\r\n<b>About Onna</b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For organizations, knowledge is power. Onna accelerates the discovery of knowledge, enabling businesses to gain valuable insights from the ever-growing amount of fragmented information that exists across the vast number of collaboration, communication and content applications. By connecting information silos, organizations can unify, protect, search, and build on top of their proprietary knowledge. With Onna, organizations save time and money, reduce risk, and use knowledge to be more competitive.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Onna\u2019s Knowledge Integration Platform connects to Slack, Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, Confluence, Dropbox, Zoom and many others, to enhance activities like eDiscovery, information governance, knowledge management, and identifying private and sensitive data sharing.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With headquarters in New York City and Barcelona and teams in Raleigh, San Francisco, Toulouse, and London, Onna supports some of the world\u2019s leading companies, including Dropbox, Electronic Arts, Lyft, Better, Carvana, and NewsCorp.

    "short_description": "Merlin Announces the Release of Merlin Integrated Search, the first to seamlessly combine keyword and algorithmic search.",
    "social_media_description": "Merlin Search Technologies today announced the release of Merlin Integrated Search (IS), a revolutionary new cloud-based software platform for investigations, discovery and compliance. Merlin IS is the first Search 2.0 platform, the first to offer keyword and algorithmic search in a user-friendly, integrated system. Drawing from the latest cutting edge search and machine-learning technology, the platform is purpose-built to make search smarter, review faster and discovery more affordable.\r\n\r\n\u201cSearch 2.0 gives you the best of both worlds, the utility of simple keywords and the power of AI machine learning,\u201d explained David Greetham, Founder of PC Forensics and former head of Ricoh\u2019s E-Discovery Business Unit. \u201cIt represents a huge leap forward over keyword searching alone and will change the way the world searches large document populations forever,\u201d he predicted.\r\n\r\n<b>Introducing Sherlock</b>\r\n\r\nMerlin IS is powered by Sherlock, the world\u2019s first AI-driven digital document bloodhound and the backbone of Merlin\u2019s Search 2.0 platform. In milliseconds, literally the blink of an eye, Sherlock can analyze the documents a user has seen, build a machine-learning model, apply it to the rest of the population and then return other highly-relevant documents to further the investigation. Simply put, Sherlock eliminates the need to craft complicated keyword searches, instead employing smart algorithms to fetch relevant documents faster, more easily, and at lower cost than traditional keyword search.\r\n\r\n\u201cSherlock will revolutionize document search the way Pandora revolutionized how we find great music,\u201d explained John Tredennick, Merlin\u2019s CEO and founder. \u201cUsers simply click \u2018Thumbs Up\u2019 or \u2018Thumbs Down\u2019 and Sherlock does the rest, quickly surfacing additional relevant documents.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe built Sherlock to be fast and scalable\u2013an order of magnitude faster than anything on the market,\u201d explained Dr. William Webber, PhD,\u00a0 Merlin\u2019s Chief Data Scientist. \u201cSherlock can analyze selected documents, build a machine-learning model, apply it to a million documents,\u00a0 and bring back more relevant documents in 100 milliseconds. That is faster than the blink of an eye. Sherlock\u00a0 can do ten million documents in a second,\u201d he explained.\r\n\r\n<b>Rave Reviews for Sherlock</b>\r\n\r\nMerlin IS is currently being used on a limited basis for several high-stakes regulatory matters as it transitions from beta. Initial reviews have been extremely positive:\r\n\r\n\u201c<i>Using Sherlock</i>\u00a0<i>in a high stakes regulatory matter, we learned more about our documents in a few days than in months\u00a0</i>with<i>\u00a0another vendor. Merlin Integrated Search is excellent \u2013 saving time for\u00a0</i>counsel<i>\u00a0and costs for clients. We can\u2019t wait to do more with it!\u201d</i>\r\n\r\nDara Tarkowski, partner and founder of Actuate Law.\r\n\r\n<i>\u201cI poked around using what I know are responsive docs and I put in a competitor name (not a\u00a0</i>party<i>\u00a0to the matter). I went into Sherlock and gave the thumbs up to a few documents and suddenly I saw highlighted terms that go straight to the heart of the matter. Sherlock knows what the case is about! What amazing magic is this? It\u2019s almost spooky.\u201d</i>\r\n\r\nDeborah Temkin, CA, CFE, Managing Member of Trace Forensic Experts, a national\u00a0investigations firm.\r\n\r\nSherlock can be used for a wide range of search needs, going well beyond e-discovery. \u201cA large team from a major healthcare provider has been using the beta version for many months,\u201c Tredennick explained. \u201cThey believe Sherlock will be a game changer for searching medical records along with medical research. We are also working with senior people from a government agency in Singapore that is interested in using Sherlock for major criminal and civil investigations.\u201d\r\n\r\n<b>Awards</b>\r\n\r\nAlthough a recent startup, Merlin has already been named a winner or is short listed for several upcoming legal innovation awards sponsored by the American Bar Association or American Lawyer Media. The Merlin team will be introducing Sherlock at the ABA Techshow in Chicago and will be presenting at ALM Legalweek in New York in March. Tredennick will also be joined by David Greetham and Deborah Temkin for an Emerging Technology presentation during Legalweek on Friday, March 11, 2022.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://merlin.tech/Press/02-23-22_Merlin_Press_Release--Merlin_Integrated_Search_Released.pdf\">Click for PDF of press release</a>.",

As an iManage customer for almost two decades, Carey saw the move to iManage Cloud as a way to reduce the complexity of managing IT in-house alongside modernizing its user experience by leveraging <a href=\"https://imanage.com/products/work/\">iManage Work 10.</a>\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s been clear for a while that cloud is the future,\u201d said Jaime Carey, Managing Partner of Carey. \u201cMoving from an on-premises deployment of iManage Work to iManage Cloud is a strategic choice by our firm to deliver a modern user experience and to keep pace with the innovation of the foremost firms across the world.\u201d\r\n\r\nCarey is working with iManage partner, <a href=\"https://www.tecnolex.cl/\">Tecnolex</a>, on the move to iManage Cloud, which will require migrating 11 terabytes of data and nearly 30 million documents and emails. An ISO27001-certified company, Tecnolex is an experienced iManage partner, skilled in migrating large amounts of confidential data. Tecnolex\u2019s strategic insight, technology expertise, and practical experience forms a critical component of Carey\u2019s technology planning and execution.\r\n\r\nThe deployment is currently scheduled to go live in March 2022, giving Carey\u2019s 500 legal professionals \u2013 including 270 lawyers \u2013 the ability to be productive from anywhere, on any device, while ensuring that their IT environment is always up to date and incorporates all available best practices and security protections.\r\n\r\n\u201cChoosing iManage Cloud, rather than trying to build and maintain a cloud on-premises, just makes sense for any law firm, even those with only 10 or 20 users,\u201d said Sebastian Carey, CEO of Tecnolex. \u201cWhile iManage is handling the cloud, the IT department can focus their time and energy on the legal workflows that matter to Carey\u2019s legal professionals and help drive better business outcomes.\u201d\r\n\r\n<strong>Staying at the forefront in all areas</strong>\r\n\r\niManage Cloud will provide the firm with a competitive advantage in several important respects, including interactions with clients.\r\n\r\n\u201cWork 10 provides the productivity, collaboration, and integration capabilities to make our lawyers\u2019 lives easier in their day-to-day work and interactions with their clients,\u201d said Jaime Carey. \u201cWe serve clients all over the world, and the General Counsels we interact with are very familiar with iManage. They understand the value that iManage delivers, and they appreciate working with a law firm who also understands the benefits it brings.\u201d\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Carey feels that having the latest technology and being on a modern knowledge work platform will be important for attracting and retaining talent within the law firm.\r\n\r\n\u201cOngoing training and development of our professionals is important to our firm,\u201d said Jaime Carey. \u201cWhen we send our associates to participate in foreign associate programs at the major law firms in New York and in London, our goal is to ensure they are either equal to or more advanced than the associates in those firms from a technological perspective. Moving to iManage Cloud ensures our professionals are staying on the cutting edge.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHaving Chile\u2019s largest full-service law select iManage Cloud is a clear testament to the value long-time customers see in changing the way they deliver a comprehensive knowledge work platform to their professionals,\u201d said Neil Araujo, iManage CEO. \u201cBy making the move to iManage Cloud, Carey is enabling the firm to work smarter, more productively, and more securely while gaining greater IT agility. The importance of these benefits cannot be overstated in an increasingly competitive legal environment.\u201d\r\n\r\n<strong>Follow iManage via:</strong>\r\n\r\nLinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/imanage\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/imanage</a>\r\n\r\nTwitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/imanageinc\">https://twitter.com/imanageinc</a>\r\n\r\nBlog: <a href=\"https://imanage.com/blog/\">https://imanage.com/blog/</a>\r\n\r\n<strong>About iManage </strong>\r\n\r\niManage is the company dedicated to Making Knowledge Work\u2122.

This, coupled with best-of-breed technology, makes a system not just work for your team but also as a critical part of your team.\r\n\r\nImagine: spending more time developing strategy, providing advice, or completing billable tasks, instead of conducting manual processes on spreadsheets, outdated software, and tedious minutiae.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://f.hubspotusercontent20.net/hubfs/4947825/Gated%20Reports/Athennian%20-%20Brand%20New%20Day%20(Case%20Studies).pdf\">Click for the white paper</a>.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>",

Elfman has won the Lifetime Achievement Award in the <a href=\"https://www.event.law.com/legalweek-leaders-tech/2022-honorees\">2022\u00a0Legalweek Leaders\u00a0in\u00a0Tech Law\u00a0Awards program</a>. The awards ceremony, scheduled for March 10 during <a href=\"https://www.event.law.com/legalweek\">Legalweek</a>, acknowledges career achievement in the development and adoption of legal technologies and legal technology companies.\r\n\r\n\u201cTwenty-five years ago, I consulted for a Fortune 10 law department that had no way to pinpoint how much money it spent on legal services,\u201d Elfman said. \u201cThat conversation inspired me to launch Datacert, an electronic invoicing and legal spend company, with Eric Smith, who is now Onit\u2019s co-founder, COO and chief security officer. Technology has indisputably evolved the business of law, and it\u2019s truly inspiring to see what our customers at Onit have accomplished. I am humbled by this recognition on behalf of Legalweek and the broader legal technology community.\u201d\r\n\r\nElfman <a href=\"https://www.onit.com/blog/celebrating-10-years-of-onit-a-podcast-with-our-four-co-founders/\">started Onit more than 10 years ago</a> with co-founders Smith, John Gilman, Onit\u2019s vice president of products, and Jill Black, vice president of marketing for Onit. The company began with two employees and $25,000 in revenue. Under Elfman\u2019s leadership as CEO, Onit <a href=\"https://www.onit.com/news/onit-secures-200-million-strategic-investment-from-k1-investment-management-to-accelerate-global-growth/\">secured a $200 million investment</a>, <a href=\"https://www.onit.com/news/onit-acquires-securedocs-broadening-its-contract-lifecycle-management-portfolio-and-market-reach/\">acquired six companies</a> and grew into a global business with more than 2,800 corporate legal customers and 600 employees.

After serving in the Navy, he earned his MBA at Rice University and established three companies in the legal space \u2013 PeerPoint, Datacert and Onit. He helped envision and create industry standards in e-billing, including the <a href=\"https://ledes.org/\">Legal Electronic Data Exchange Standard (LEDES)</a> and the <a href=\"https://utbms.com/\">Uniform Task Based Management System (UTBMS)</a>.\r\n\r\nIn addition to acknowledging Elfman, the awards ceremony will also celebrate Onit\u2019s legal operations management subsidiary, <a href=\"https://www.simplelegal.com/\">SimpleLegal</a>.

The transaction creates the first legal technology platform integrating real-time CRM into practice management and financial data, allowing law firms to holistically manage and grow client relationships.\r\n\r\nThis move vaults the company ahead of competitors still developing cloud-based financial management solutions and incorporating CRM for law firms. Part of an emphasis on strategic, systemic growth, the acquisition further empowers SurePoint to fulfill its vision of transforming the legal industry by automating administrative processes to allow lawyers more time to focus on their practices.\r\n\r\n\u201cOur clients were adamant that CRM is the next feature we should incorporate into our platform. ContactEase provides the best solution on the market,\u201d said SurePoint Chief Executive Officer Tom Obermaier. \u201cOur two companies share a similar trajectory and history, a corresponding middle market client base, complementary values and corporate cultures, and the ability and desire to merge two state-of-the-art platforms into one groundbreaking best-in-class solution for all legal management and marketing needs.\u201d\r\n\r\nContactEase has earned a reputation for combining powerful features with extreme usability and for its industry-leading adoption rate \u2013 a prodigious 90%, as compared to 50% industrywide. The technology captures competitive intelligence on clients, prospects and other contacts while tracking and reporting business development activity.\r\n\r\nThe technology operates seamlessly within Outlook and includes integration with Hubspot. It allows professionals with a touch of the keyboard to open a pop-up window displaying a complete history of the firm\u2019s interactions with a contact. From a single pane, law firm marketing teams can easily initiate email campaigns, and users can share, manage and leverage data to ensure the right people get the right information at the right time. The results are enhanced client and prospect relationships and an increased ability to retain and acquire clients.\r\n\r\n\u201cIncorporating ContactEase into SurePoint\u2019s easy-to-use platform made sense for the next phase of our technology\u2019s growth onto the cloud,\u201d said Cole Valley President Jennifer Whittier. \u201cOur approach to bringing visibility to every facet of contact connection will now include essential financial data, generating new avenues for lawyers intent on developing a thriving book of business. We anticipate law firms will enthusiastically embrace the opportunity to easily access a single source of information.\u201d\r\n\r\nBy acquiring ContactEase, SurePoint has obtained a turnkey, highly functional CRM system providing business data, insight and prospecting tools that, when incorporated in SurePoint\u2019s own financial reporting and client management system, will capture return on investment (ROI) for business development. Until now, ROI has been a missing link when attempting to evaluate law firm business development efforts. Obtaining that data gives law firms the ability to better communicate with clients and prospects and understand more aspects of client relationships.\r\n\r\n\u201cSurePoint asked what we needed, listened to our suggestions, then engineered a solution,\u201d said Jaclyn Braga, Director of Marketing at Morse. \u201cWe\u2019ve become accustomed to their user-friendly software and hassle-free customer service. Adding ContactEase\u2019s proven CRM to SurePoint\u2019s already exceptional software suite offers value that increases our loyalty, because it opens up more opportunities to better serve our clients.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs part of the transaction, all of ContactEase\u2019s workforce will become part of the SurePoint team. The combined customer base will expand to 600 mid-sized law firms. ContactEase remains available as a stand-alone product for both its present and new users.\r\n\r\n\u201cSurePoint\u2019s acquisition was perfect timing to coincide with our company\u2019s transition,\u201d said Cole Valley Founder Jeff Reade. \u201cI always envisioned ContactEase as a component in a holistic client-management environment, and I\u2019m delighted that SurePoint has the capability to take ContentEase to its next incarnation.

    "social_media_description": "SurePoint Technologies, the leading cloud provider of practice management solutions for law firms, announced today the launch of its cutting-edge cloud-based time management system, SureTime. The new platform integrates with the existing SurePoint Legal Management System (LMS), allowing SaaS law firm clients to benefit from an improved time management experience.\r\n\r\nAmong other user-friendly offerings, the SureTime platform is accessible by smartphone, laptop or desktop. It allows users the option to make time entries by voice command and typing. It also automatically tracks time when users are working in Microsoft applications such as Word, Excel and Outlook. The powerful platform\u2019s timekeeping tracks entries for future calendar items, eliminating the need for the user to do this on their own.\r\n\r\nThe software also boasts advanced search capabilities and a predictive feature, remembering recurring tasks and anticipating the clients and matters users are most likely to select when making entries. Compatibility with Google Workspace will be introduced in the future.\r\n\r\n\u201cOur goal was to create a time management application for law firms that is increasingly intuitive, easy to utilize and captures time automatically,\u201d said SurePoint Chief Executive Officer Tom Obermaier. \u201cIn addition to its simplicity, we also wanted to create a solution that can be adopted by everyone at a law firm, from paralegals to IT staff to the marketing department \u2014 not just lawyers.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe innovative solution\u2019s undemanding operation does more than just improve the experience of lawyers and law firm staff tasked with contemporaneously tracking their time. It also tracks performance through daily and monthly views and streamlines the billing process.\r\n\r\n\u201cWith SureTime, the burden of entering time is eliminated, which ultimately opens up valuable hours that can be spent on other important and high-value tasks,\u201d said Angela Armes, Vice President, Product for SurePoint.\r\n\r\nSurePoint will be providing a demo for existing and prospective customers at LegalWeek, which will be held in New York City March 8-11, 2022. Those interested in attending can experience SureTime at Booth #3116 in Americas Hall 2.\r\n\r\n\u201cEmpowering our attorneys with technology to develop innovative solutions and deliver unparalleled client service is key to our mission. SureTime is a progressive tool that can be used without going through a time-consuming training process,\u201d said Karen H. Frank, IT Manager at client Manning Fulton. \u201cIt is a solution that is hassle-free and does not create an administrative burden for its users and enables them to focus on their clients.\u201d\r\n\r\nYou can learn more about the SureTime platform <a href=\"https://surepoint.com/solutions-overview/suretime/\">here</a>.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220207005247/en/SurePoint-Technologies-Announces-Launch-of-Law-Firm-Time-Management-Solution-SureTime\">Click for Press Release</a>.",

Knowing where data and systems exist has typically been identified by humans, but today, technology is being used to support human knowledge that tends to have natural flaws,\u201d said Eric Derk, Managing Director of Forensics at Ernst and Young, LLP. \"Besides the wasted time spent creating and maintaining manual, static inventories, there is a high cost of human resources and risk of error associated with this approach. Siloed methods do not provide holistic views of an entire data universe, and unknowingly put organizations at risk, resulting in a false sense of security that leaves organizations vulnerable to the exposure of sensitive data.\"\r\n\r\nActiveNav\u2019s <strong>Inventory\u2122</strong> rearchitects data discovery, transforming it from a cumbersome, episodic chore to a persistent, always-on approach that monitors the compliance risk posture of any enterprise. <strong>Inventory\u2122</strong> solves preparedness issues by mapping vulnerable hotspots of sensitive data and generating toxicity heat maps using customizable scoring.\r\n\r\n<strong>Inventory\u2122</strong> enables organizations to:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Discover, score and monitor user-generated data across commonly used applications like Microsoft SharePoint and Teams, as well as email, workplace collaboration platforms and on-premise file shares.</li>\r\n \t<li>Assess their compliance risk profile using customizable, prebuilt rules to prioritize and highlight \u201ctoxicity hotspots\u201d in their data universe via a single pane of glass.</li>\r\n \t<li>Apply AI to allow teams to maintain an accurate, holistic view of their data risk profile.</li>\r\n \t<li>Leverage the Microsoft Azure SaaS stack for industry-leading security, performance and scalability.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong>New Privacy Laws and Lack of Preparedness Create Urgency</strong>\r\n\r\nThe passage of newly enacted privacy laws in California, Colorado and Virginia has exacerbated the need to take a more automated, persistent approach to managing sensitive data in user-generated content systems such as Microsoft Teams and Slack. In today\u2019s compliance landscape, Privacy and Compliance departments know they must be prepared to act quickly, putting sensitive data visibility at the top of the priority list.\r\n\r\nResults from a recent\u00a0<a href=\"https://activenav.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Osterman.pdf\">Osterman Research</a>\u00a0survey corroborate this new sense of urgency. This recent study found that almost \u201c90% of respondents say discovering sensitive data is a high or medium priority in their organization.\u201d Organizations in three industries\u2014healthcare/pharma, technology, and financial services\u2014were more likely to say discovering sensitive data was a high priority.\r\n\r\n\u201cHistorical sensitive data discovery efforts have failed and are in need of a major reboot,\u201d said Peter Baumann, CEO and Founder of ActiveNav. \u201cPrivacy and Compliance teams are fooling themselves into believing they have the right solutions for discovering sensitive data, but they often don't know what data they should be protecting and how they should protect it.<strong> Inventory\u2122 </strong>shines a light on the problem in an automated, persistent way that originates from our decades worth of work helping the largest enterprises monitor and manage sensitive data.\u201d\r\n\r\n<strong>About ActiveNav</strong>\r\nActiveNav is a data privacy and governance software provider and innovator of the hybrid-cloud data mapping solution, <strong>Inventory\u2122</strong>, which enables users to identify toxic data hotspots and prioritize their minimization efforts through risk scoring and unique heat maps. With ActiveNav, organizations can map, clean, classify, quarantine, and delete sensitive, redundant, obsolete, and trivial data.

Casepoint recently became an official\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.casepoint.com/ediscovery-platform/slack-enterprise/?utm_source=prnewswire&amp;utm_medium=press-release&amp;utm_campaign=pr-3-8-2022-slack\">Slack Technology Partner</a>, enabling direct collections from Slack for customers utilizing Casepoint\u2019s powerful eDiscovery and legal hold applications.\r\n\r\nCasepoint\u2019s Chief Revenue Officer David Carns said, \u201cThe addition of Slack and Teams is in direct response to corporate and government customers\u2019 growing use of these messaging and collaboration platforms.\u201d\u00a0Carns will be a featured speaker at the Legalweek RegTech track session \u201c<a href=\"https://www.event.law.com/legalweek/agenda\">Solving Compliance and Regulatory Issues with AI Detection and Tracking Tools</a>\u201d\u00a0at 11:00 a.m. ET on Thursday, March 10.\r\n\r\nCasepoint\u2019s integrated and automated collection capabilities for Slack, Teams, and other popular collaboration tools speed the entire eDiscovery process from\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.casepoint.com/press/casepoint-expands-legal-hold-collection-collaboration-intelligent-processing/?utm_source=prnewswire&amp;utm_medium=press-release&amp;utm_campaign=pr-3-8-2022-slack\">legal hold</a>\u00a0to review and production.\u00a0These latest cloud connectors substantially improve the ability of corporations, government agencies, law firms, and their corporate clients to collect and produce data in eDiscovery or investigations. Importantly, the cloud connectors dramatically reduce the number of touch points, data exposure risks, and costs of the process. A\u00a0single legal professional can import data into the platform, apply integrated analytics capabilities to gain immediate insights into results, and identify relevant data to be provided to counsel.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are very excited to add Slack and Microsoft Teams to our growing list of cloud connectors,\u201d said Vishal Rajpara, Chief Technology Officer at Casepoint. \u201cOur fast expansion in this area is a direct response to the urgent need for corporations and law firms to manage expanding data volumes and types more efficiently and proactively, which we have done by making these capabilities an integrated element of their eDiscovery platform.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOne of our unique advantages lies in the rapidity with which we can respond to customer requests for additional connectors, thanks to the strength of our technology and agility of our development team,\u201d Rajpara emphasized.\r\n\r\nWhereas other providers offer bolted-on integration, Casepoint\u2019s connectors are integrated with its technology ecosystem from the ground up. The company\u2019s unique technology and agile engineering strengths allow it to work closely with individual customers to quickly build connectors to meet specific needs.\r\n\r\nRajpara said, \u201cAs an example, we built an API in six weeks for one of the world\u2019s largest freight transportation companies that needed to connect Casepoint to one of their existing systems. This enabled new workflow efficiencies and reporting capabilities that the client never had before.\u201d\r\n\r\nCasepoint\u2019s technology features fast, enterprise-class\u00a0solutions for full-spectrum\u00a0legal discovery.\u00a0With Casepoint, customers can manage and monitor the entire discovery process\u2014from\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.casepoint.com/ediscovery-platform/legal-hold-software/\">legal hold</a>\u00a0to production to review\u2014entirely within its unified platform, eliminating the need to log in and out of other applications or manually transfer files. With Casepoint\u2019s growing list of connectors, customers can directly access applications to collect files and relevant metadata in their native format without risking data security and maintaining a seamless experience.\r\n\r\nCasepoint representatives will be available during Legalweek at Booth #305.\u00a0<a href=\"https://legalweek.casepoint.com/\">https://legalweek.casepoint.com/</a>\r\n\r\n<b>\r\n</b><b>About Casepoint</b>\r\n\r\nCasepoint is the legal technology platform of choice for corporations, government agencies, and law firms to meet their complex eDiscovery, investigations, and compliance needs.

    "social_media_description": "A few months ago, we were mesmerised by DALL\u00b7E 2\u2019s ability to generate realistic images and art based on short descriptions. Now the people behind DALL\u00b7E 2 have gone viral again with the launch of ChatGPT.\r\n\r\nBoth DALLE and ChatGPT highlight the advancements in generative AI. Compared to predictive AI, generative models have impressively fluent results, however, their quality is harder to assess. How do we know if a blog generated with ChatGPT is correct or if it\u2019s accurate? Most of the output is fluent, and tangentially relevant, however these systems are inherently unreliable, making errors of both reasoning and fact.\r\n\r\nWhile machine translation models are inherently predictive, where both accuracy and precision are expected, generative models like ChatGPT can open up new avenues for translators and the localization industry.\r\n\r\nThe cost of creating content will drop, which means that even more content will be created. This creates a need for linguistic services for revising, adapting, and certifying the AI output. The concept of\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.rws.com/blog/why-training-is-the-bridge-to-linguistic-AI-enablement/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Machine Translation Post Editing</a>\u00a0will expand into linguistic validation, cultural adaptation, tone adjustment, fact checking and bias removal.\r\n\r\nAnother application is generating shorter or longer examples of the translation to help with formatting in-context. It is clear that NMT models will be complemented by LLMs for improving fluency or offering value added services like content insight.\r\n\r\nWhile ChatGPT isn\u2019t quite there yet \u2013 it\u2019s certainly raised interest in conversational AI and the possibilities around the technology. But, is it going to transform the translation industry? No - it still has a long way to go. And until then it\u2019s important to remember that only a robust, secure, and adaptable\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.rws.com/language-weaver/neural-machine-translation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">NMT solution</a>\u00a0can be trusted if you\u2019re looking to engage with global audiences.",

    "social_media_description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Depending on where you look, a coming recession is either\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-17/forecast-for-us-recession-within-year-hits-100-in-blow-to-biden?leadSource=uverify%20wall\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">inevitable</a>\u00a0or just\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/banking/federal-reserve/economic-indicator-survey-recession-risks-october-2022/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">very likely</a>. One thing is clear: Economic uncertainty will be a fact of life in 2023 and it will affect just about every industry, including legal services. Looking ahead, \u201cnew law\u201d solutions that offer flexible resourcing, such as\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.priorilegal.com/how-it-works\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">legal marketplaces</a>, may help fill many of the gaps that companies will experience during this uncertain future.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To get a full picture of the current legal services market, you need to look back to the current economic downturn\u2019s precursor, the Great Resignation, during which employees left the legal industry in record numbers. For law firms and corporate legal departments alike, the result has been vacancies that are taking too long to fill in the face of a workload that is as busy as ever, despite fewer resources to rely on.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So, what is the impact of the Great Resignation and economic downturn on the legal industry, and how will those trends fuel the rise of alternatives to the traditional law firm model? For many companies, one answer to the current predicament has been to turn to legal marketplaces, staffing firms or alternative legal service providers (ALSPs) to address their needs quickly and cost-effectively.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.priorilegal.com/blog/how-flexible-resourcing-through-legal-marketplaces-can-fill-gaps-during-a-recession\">Click for full article</a>.</p>",

    "social_media_description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">A legal marketplace has many advantages for buyers in need of legal services. Think of it as a platform like Zillow: You can put in a variety of criteria to perform a search, and then analyze the results and find exactly what fits your needs, whether that is a certain price, location, type of transaction or almost any other data point you would want to use. Companies searching for legal services on\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.priorilegal.com/how-it-works\">Priori Marketplace</a>\u00a0can find lawyers on our network to handle almost any kind of project. The most common needs fall into four main categories:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Project based support, whether niche expertise, local counsel or simply searching for cost-effective alternatives</p>\r\n</li>\r\n \t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Overflow support for high-volume company work (commercial contracts, NDAs, healthcare agreements, employment matters, marketing and advertising, data privacy and security, etc.)</p>\r\n</li>\r\n \t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Staffing support, including secondments</p>\r\n</li>\r\n \t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Supporting outside counsel diversity and inclusion initiatives</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If your legal department is looking to hire outside counsel, you might be wondering what finding a provider on a legal marketplace looks like, and what the advantages are compared to your other options. Using a legal marketplace is as easy as performing a search. <a href=\"https://www.priorilegal.com/blog/how-does-a-legal-marketplace-work\">Learn how it works in this article</a>.</p>",

They can effectively manage your infrastructure and cloud demand and ensure your other crucial IT infrastructure runs smoothly. Although many companies prefer initially to take care by themselves of their IT environment, with the growth of the business, the complexity is increasing rapidly and you either need to recruit more IT people or outsource part of the activities externally.\r\n\r\nThe salaries for infrastructure managers and cloud experts in the USA are starting from $154,728 per year according to Indeed.com. These costs increase with all the additional spending on recruitment agencies and headhunters. So in reality maintaining a vast IT team internally may consume a significant budget and still does not guarantee that everything will run smoothly and with no downtime.\r\n\r\nEngaging with an experienced managed service provider can help you solve some of the toughest IT challenges:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Increased complexity</li>\r\n \t<li>Demand for better availability and security</li>\r\n \t<li>Avoiding vendor lock-in</li>\r\n \t<li>Paying thousands of USD for licenses</li>\r\n \t<li>Staying compliant</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<a href=\"https://cloudscale365.com/do-you-need-to-engage-with-a-managed-service-provider-infographic/\">In this info-graphic</a>, the team of CloudScale365, Inc. is helping you to find out whether it is the right time to engage with an MSP.

Privacy experts will discuss recent developments, changes on the horizon, and strategies for navigating these obligations.\r\n\r\n<strong>Avoiding Data Disasters: Protecting Sensitive Information in Search, Review, and Production</strong>\r\n\r\n2:00 p.m. \u2013 3:00 p.m. ET\r\n\r\nSpeaker: Jane Funk\r\n\r\nLocation: The Beekman Room\r\n\r\nOrganizations struggle to adequately protect their private and confidential information in the ordinary course of business.

    "short_description": "Major Technology Challenges for Legal Businesses and How to Transform them Into Opportunities",
    "social_media_description": "<h2><strong>Top Challenges for Legal Companies when Dealing with Technology and What has changed</strong></h2>\r\nOne of the most significant changes is the evolving legal landscape, which has impacted how law firms need to consider their relationship with technology. Legal companies must now consider various factors, including the need for secure communication that cannot become a subject of cyber-attacks, data loss, and more. Additionally, a stable online presence has become essential as more and more law companies generate their clients online, and everything is going digital. Clients now prefer online consultations and need an online space to store their confidential data. As a result, legal companies must adapt to these changes to remain competitive and meet the needs of their clients.\r\n\r\n<b>Cyber-security</b><strong>:</strong> As the number and sophistication of cyber-crimes continue to grow, the threat to businesses is increasingly growing. Law firms are particularly vulnerable to such threats due to the sensitive and valuable data they manage and the outdated cyber-security systems that many firms in the sector still employ. Cyber-security requires extensive, long-term investment into your IT infrastructure and cyber-security staff. This may be especially difficult for smaller law firms that might not have the necessary resources to provide adequate protection. MSPs can help law firms by providing a secure cloud to store and protect their data from cyber threats.\r\n\r\n<strong>Clients\u2019 data protection:\u00a0</strong>Client expectations around data protection are also increasing. Clients are becoming more aware of the risks of having their confidential information reside on an attorney\u2019s unprotected computer. Law firms must create protection policies that secure client data, which can be easy to do with the right tools. However, it is practically impossible if things aren\u2019t set up correctly.\r\n\r\n<strong>Law professionals expect a hybrid/remote model:</strong>\u00a0The ability to work from anywhere is powerful, and it is also seen as something of a perq by attorneys. Today\u2019s remote staff, need the same environment, whether in the office or remotely. Technology complexity should not distract them from the billable business.\u00a0Even recruiters must have a story ready to sell potential new hires on how efficiently and effectively the firm\u2019s IT infrastructure supports their ability to work remotely.\r\n\r\n<strong>Compliance:\u00a0</strong>Compliance is a significant challenge for law companies due to the constantly changing legal and regulatory environment. As new laws and regulations are introduced, law firms must ensure they meet all compliance requirements. This can be daunting, especially for firms operating in multiple jurisdictions with varying regulations. Additionally, the growing use of technology in legal services has increased the risk of data breaches and cyber attacks, making compliance even more crucial. To stay compliant, law firms must adopt modern technology and digital workplace solutions tailored to regulations and meet the needs of lawyers and clients. These innovative solutions ensure the secure exchange and storage of data and facilitate smooth communication between firm professionals and clients to enable more effective collaboration.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://cloudscale365.com/major-technology-challenges-for-legal-businesses-and-how-to-transform-them-into-opportunities/\">Click to continue reading</a>.",

    "short_description": "Harrier Candidates - Anonymised Talent Platform Launch, Press Release",
    "social_media_description": "Harrier Search, the first bespoke recruitment agency to serve the LegalTech community, has just launched an anonymised talent marketplace (<a href=\"http://www.harriercandidates.com/\">Harrier Candidates</a>) that will bring transparency to the salaries on offer in what is still a new sector but also to the skills that are required for the variety of roles in LegalTech &amp; Legal Operations.\r\n\r\nCommission rates for candidates sourced via the talent marketplace will be as low as 11% for logo customers. The other benefit to employers is speed. Not only will employers be able to identify and approach talent on Day 1 of a search, but before the search has even begun they can advise the Harrier team of their future needs and in turn the team will encourage candidates to sign up in anticipation of the role going live. Employers who would benefit from the talent marketplace include:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>in-house legal teams looking to hire legal operations professionals;</li>\r\n \t<li>law firms in need of technologists, legal engineers, developers, thought leaders and those involved in the wider business of law such as Knowledge lawyers and Legal IT professionals;</li>\r\n \t<li>LegalTech vendors and consultancies with vacancies in Sales, Product, Business Development, Engineering, Customer Success and Leadership roles.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nHarrier\u2019s founder, Henry Venmore-Rowland (first non-technical hire at Luminance) explains why he chose this approach: \u201cI\u2019m grateful for the lessons I learned having joined a LegalTech company pre-launch to the point where it had 120 customers globally. Traditional recruitment agencies are dependent on hiring consultants to grow, which means high commission rates to cover overheads, searches that can drag on for weeks and a shortlisting process that isn\u2019t always transparent. A platform approach empowers candidates and employers alike, potentially halves costs and reduces time to hire.\u201d\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.harriercandidates.com/\">Harrier Candidates</a> will be free to all candidates and of value to everyone from active jobseekers through to those with no intention to leave their employer. Signing up to the platform grants guest access, which will allow users to do their own benchmarking of skills and salaries. Candidates will also self-rate how active or passive they are as a jobseeker to encourage or deter potential employers from reaching out with live roles. Crucially, current renumeration is hidden from employers but desired renumeration is shared. No employer will have access to profiles of their own employees while browsing.\r\n\r\nThe platform already has its first 15 employers signed up pre-launch. Most of the LegalTech companies operate in the UK, but they also represent employers from Singapore, Sweden, Australia, Germany and the US. The marketplace is also currently free at point of use to employers, but once a threshold of candidates is met there will be a subscription charge, except for early adopters who will have a grace period for all 2023.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

    "social_media_description": "Technology pioneer\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.hanzo.co/\" rel=\"noopener\">Hanzo</a>, a provider of enterprise solutions for legal, governance, and compliance teams is proud to introduce Hanzo Command Center. Designed to work seamlessly with Hanzo\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.hanzo.co/illuminate\" rel=\"noopener\">Illuminate</a>, Hanzo Command Center is a Slack ediscovery application that allows users to create matters securely, initiate legal holds, add custodians, and trigger collections in either Slack or Google Workspace directly from within Slack.\r\n\r\nToday, users perform many daily tasks within collaboration platforms such as Slack. Research has also shown that \u201ccontext switching\u201d between platforms and applications takes a toll on productivity and stress levels. Slack, in conjunction with GlobalWebIndex, \u201creported in their 2019 Slack State of Work\u201d report that 64% of aligned workers report spending 30+ minutes daily switching apps resulting in 130+ lost hours a year just switching between applications.\r\n\r\n<em>\u201cUnderstanding Slack's Digital HQ philosophy that encourages more work to be contained and performed within Slack to facilitate greater productivity was at the forefront of our thinking when designing Command Center,\u201d said Dave Ruel, Head of Product, Hanzo. \u201cIt was important for us to empower enterprise legal teams to improve their workflows by enabling them to manage ediscovery processes in Slack where they were already working.\u201d</em>\r\n\r\nHanzo\u2019s Command Center eliminates productivity-killing context-switching and enables enterprise legal teams to perform eDiscovery duties up to 50% faster* than using Hanzo Illuminate alone. The Slack-based application also provides a guided workflow from matter creation to collection, making the entire process easier to navigate and perform. (<a href=\"https://hanzo-archives.wistia.com/medias/vekqckpuoh\">Watch the video)</a>\r\n\r\n<em>*Hanzo internal benchmark tests have shown that matter creation and custodian assignments are up to 50% faster using Command Center than Illuminate alone.</em>\r\n\r\nCommand Center comes as a feature application for Hanzo Illuminate customers who also have a Slack enterprise grid license and/or Google Business Plus or Enterprise license. Existing Hanzo Illuminate customers will gain access to this application at no additional cost. Following is a list of functions included in the Hanzo Command Center application.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>Matter Creation</strong>\u00a0- Create a matter within Hanzo Illuminate with a name, description, data sources, and optional start/end dates</li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Add Custodian</strong>\u00a0- Add custodian(s) to existing Hanzo Illuminate matters at any point in the ediscovery process.</li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Collect Matter</strong>\u00a0- Trigger a matter collection with optional start/end dates for Slack/Gmail/GDrive data sources.</li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Matter List\u00a0</strong>- Generate a Matter List in Command Center\u2019s \u201cMessages\u201d area.</li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Custodian List</strong>\u00a0- Generate a list of custodians for a selected matter within the Command Center\u2019s \u201cMessages\u201d area.</li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Channel List\u00a0</strong>- Generate a list of channels for a selected matter within the Command Center\u2019s \u201cMessages\u201d area.</li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Close Matter</strong>\u00a0- Close a matter in Hanzo Illuminate. This terminates matter syncing into Slack and releases custodians from hold in Slack and/or Google Vault.</li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Shortcut Actions</strong>\u00a0- All features above are available via shortcuts in the Command Center Messages area.</li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Messages Area</strong>\u00a0- Actions performed in Command Center are logged in the Messages area. Users can search the message area for custodians, actions, matter names, etc.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>About Hanzo</h3>\r\nHanzo helps global enterprises manage and reduce legal risk wherever work gets done.

    "social_media_description": "<a href=\"https://cyferd.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cyferd</a>\u00a0is delighted to announce its recent acquisition of Tetrakursio, a Spain-based company that specializes in a recursive engine to streamline the language between microservices to scale. As the company\u2019s first-ever acquisition, coming only a year after its launch, Cyferd is excited to be bringing on a technology that enables easier user-defined workflows and automation.\r\n\r\nSo, what does this mean for Cyferd? The company hopes to use Tetrakursio\u2019s \u2018T-ReX\u2019 engine in the quest for effective agile digital transformation through accelerating the development of microservice architecture. Tetrakursio\u2019s mission aims to make developers\u2019 lives easier by using recursion (the process of one value relying on its predecessor to perform operations) to enable automated workflows.\r\n\r\nNacho Bibi\u00e1n, Director at Tetrakursio, is excited to be able to use the recursive engine to help achieve breakthroughs in digital transformation.\r\n\r\n\u201cMicroservices are the fundamental building blocks of any platform,\u201d Bibi\u00e1n notes. \u201cIn order to break a huge program down into multiple microservices, you have to address all the potential questions that can surface: how do these services interact with each other? How do they interact with the wider program network?\u201d\r\n\r\nPreviously, organizations had to deal with a program that was difficult to maintain and \u2018break down\u2019 into microservices, argues Bibi\u00e1n. With Tetrakursio, organizations can transform from a long and difficult journey to one that\u2019s almost instantaneous.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.abnewswire.com/uploads/1794a475e18afd945e9dcaba626f7e58.png\" alt=\"\" />\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Cyferd Platform takes a unique approach to data-focused digital transformation by tackling the problem of data fragmentation and data silos at the source. The platform enables users to create scalable, secure business applications in the cloud without the requirement for coding, accelerating digital business transformation. With Cyferd, users can reap the benefits of cloud minus the complexity and reduce the barriers to business innovation.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe timeline for this acquisition is astonishing,\u201d Ranjit Bahia, founder, and CEO of Cyferd, notes. \u201cIn just under one year, we\u2019ve gone from launching ourselves as a company to building out and taking on additional teams. We\u2019re excited to see how Tetrakursio helps emphasize Cyferd\u2019s \u2018low work\u2019 mission.\u201d\r\n\r\nCyferd has already drawn up plans for the incorporation of the \u2018T-ReX\u2019 engine into the Cyferd Platform, where customers of the platform will be able to create business applications in a fraction of the time it would previously take.\r\n\r\nFor more information, you can find out more information about Cyferd\u00a0<a href=\"https://cyferd.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>\u00a0and Tetrakursio\u00a0<a href=\"https://tetrakursio.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.",

    "social_media_description": "Since the events of the Grenfell Tower fire on June 14, 2017, several organisations in the United Kingdom have been focused on ameliorating and improving building strategies in the UK \u2013 to ensure that such a tragedy would never be repeated.\r\n\r\nBut the issues of the built environment in the UK extend far beyond Grenfell; such is the premise of Dame Judith Hackitt\u2019s 2018 Building a Safer Future report. The report outlines the concept of a \u2018golden thread\u2019; this was the suggestion that digital information needed to be effectively introduced and managed to enable decision-making through all stages of a building. The thread links all people and processes together as part of a broader strategy to make sure that built environment and building strategies within the UK are safer than ever.\r\n\r\nBut, how exactly does this function in practice? What does this mean for organisations?\r\n\r\nThe built environment has never been a more important issue for Data Clan, a Yorkshire-based solutions collective pioneering innovative ways to tackle issues and streamline organizational change. Data Clan is a multi-disciplinary research and consultancy firm with a passion for getting things done and a reputation for talking straight. Their track record certainly reflects it: CEO Chris Lees and Executive Director for Research Dr Rob Wray are working pro-bono on developing BRAC Golden Thread advice.\r\n\r\nData Clan utilises a cross-disciplinary approach to built environment and building challenges, enhancing outcomes like cost-efficiency, organisational cohesion, and solution efficacy, particularly in the context of safety-critical systems.\r\n\r\nAs Data Clan announces the \u201c<strong>Age of Data</strong>\u201d, they take a tech-focused approach to their new partnership agreement with digital transformation platform Cyferd. The partnership, which was signed this week, aims to combine digital innovation expertise and technology to help implement emergent Golden Thread requirements for the building industry.\r\n\r\nCyferd is innovating a digital transformation platform that enables users to streamline business processes through the creation of cloud-native, secure, no-code business applications. As they grow their platform, Data Clan\u2019s extensive experience in the building industry will help them achieve solutions across the entire sector.\r\n\r\nChris Lees, CEO of Data Clan, said, \u201cWe are delighted to play our part in improving building safety, and this partnership allows us to apply Cyferd\u2019s innovative platform to the existing and new challenges of digital asset information management. We see the potential to exploit the rapid deployment and lower total cost of ownership of the platform with clients in the housing and real estate sectors to meet both forthcoming legislative needs and current digital transformation ambitions.\u201d\r\n\r\nGreg Merten, SVP of Alliances and Partners at Cyferd, notes how critical Golden Thread policy is to linking aspects of the built environment.\r\n\r\n\u201cFrom the building owner to the construction worker, we can work with Data Clan to enable them to continue to innovate solutions to help connect communities with the buildings they\u2019re intertwined in.\u201d",

    "social_media_description": "<em>Hanzo significantly improves the corporate legal team\u2019s experience managing Microsoft Teams data for ediscovery through pre-collection intelligence, allowing innovative, targeted collections and rapid actionable insights during data analysis.</em>\r\n\r\nHanzo, a global provider of enterprise solutions for legal, governance, and compliance teams, announces the first pre-collection dynamic mapping technology for\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.hanzo.co/microsoft_teams\" rel=\"noopener\">Microsoft Teams</a>. Hanzo's Dynamic Mapping technology for Slack powers Hanzo Illuminate, the industry's first intelligent collection and culling solution for collaboration data empowering enterprise ediscovery teams with best-in-class defensibility and reduction of extraneous data collections by up to\u00a085 percent.*\r\n\r\nMicrosoft Teams collaboration data has grown to nearly 80% market share** and is increasingly becoming a standard request during the legal ediscovery process. Hanzo's proprietary technology automatically addresses a critical enterprise ediscovery challenge of automating analysis for huge volumes of data and pinpointing what to collect, reducing the hassle, cost, time, and risk typical of enterprise ediscovery and downstream review processes.\r\n\r\n<em>\"Why collect everything into a data lake when it is unnecessary,\" posited Hanzo VP of Product Dave Ruel. \"We know from our years of experience with collaborative data that the scale and complexity of enterprises require a better way to target their collections. They need up-front intelligence to help them effectively cull it to improve all downstream workflows.\"\u00a0</em>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/cD2TLa2KGasXCLq-nFzULkiA4UwyciqwYgBqF3JGCOsiGpslzt4uK-lbxw6lR1LIuGiM9tWvPbngFjsF6C59inRMNZxeodwJUFMNHQX0hoSzSTOANpJLmcpcCSVo_isOoU8tvrK7QBpe\" width=\"530\" height=\"792\" data-mce-paste=\"true\" />\r\n<h6>Dynamic Mapping offers enterprises a pre-collection preview</h6>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAnother typical challenge enterprises face with Microsoft Teams collaboration data is needing more critical context for efficient ECA evaluation. Time and context are especially essential for enterprises when navigating vast amounts of messaging data. Hanzo's pre-collection intelligence speeds up early case assessment by highlighting where the conversations are happening. Unlike many competitive solutions offered today, Hanzo automatically organizes messaging content into contextual threaded conversations because reviewing data in siloed streams as is standard in Microsoft Purview is complex and inefficient, especially at the scale large enterprises face.\r\n\r\n<em>\"Hanzo's mission is to quickly and accurately reduce the noise pointing users to the truth within their data as soon as possible,\" commented Ruel. \"We leverage our vast experience helping enterprises navigate the complexities and vast volumes of collaboration data, so they have the information they need to limit their risk and make better decisions regarding case strategy.\"</em>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.hanzo.co/hs-fs/hubfs/Product%20Marketing/product_images/microsoft_teams/2023_hanzo_microsoft_teams.gif?width=640&amp;height=360&amp;name=2023_hanzo_microsoft_teams.gif\" alt=\"2023_hanzo_microsoft_teams\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" />\r\n\r\nHanzo Illuminate offers enterprise legal teams key features that significantly improve the user experience:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>Pre-Collection Intelligence\u00a0</strong>- Provide enterprise teams with a preview of their collaboration environment before collection to target collections, efficiently respond to ediscovery requests, and conduct investigations.</li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Contextual Data Threading\u00a0</strong>- Automatic contextual threading of Microsoft Teams communication data brings the entire conversation into view, delivering clarity and chronological context essential for understanding while saving mission-critical time.</li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Pre-Packaged Review-Platform-Ready Exports</strong>\u00a0- Streamline processes with review-platform-ready exports. Efficiently review custodial chat data in context, including edits/deletes, metadata, message/custodial relationships, and more.

Built with the most intuitive UI in mind, the tool guides the user through their investigations by providing insights along the way and makes it easy to find the most relevant data on any matters before collection occurs, significantly improving the speed of responses by legal teams.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Additionally, we have expanded Live EDA\u2019s support for Google Workspace with Archive, preservation Hold and in-place search capabilities for Google drive. Live EDA is also newly integrated with Microsoft information protection allowing full access to encrypted data, leveraging tags to inform investigations and the full eDiscovery process.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The new user interface is just one of the improvements IPRO has made to Live EDA since it was launched nearly two years ago.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">IPRO\u2019s Live EDA tool can connect to more than 20 data sources and display search results in one place. That capability enables Live EDA\u2019s instant, in-place search capability to reduce collection volumes by more than 80% versus traditional eDiscovery methods because less extraneous information is collected from the outset. This generates tremendous time and cost savings for IPRO\u2019s customers by empowering them to make informed decisions about potential litigation before conducting a full eDiscovery process.</span>",

Hanzo\u2019s Illuminate is the industry's first intelligent collection and culling solution empowering ediscovery teams to tame high volumes of complex enterprise collaboration data effectively. From pre-collection through early case assessment, Illuminate provides best-in-class defensibility and productivity-enhancing insights so organizations can proactively manage risk.\r\n\r\nHanzo solutions address the unprecedented challenges large enterprises face post-pandemic of massive volumes of highly complex collaboration data. In the last two years, Hanzo has seen data associated with collaboration communications grow exponentially. This reality has changed the conversation from defensibly preserving information to a requirement of cost-effectively controlling data volumes, managing complexity, and, most notably, getting rapid insights for investigations and informed case strategy.\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px\"><em>\u201cIt's not uncommon for large organizations to have to make sense of thousands of channels and millions of messages,\" commented Dave Ruel, VP of Product at Hanzo. \"We're embedding AI in Illuminate and adding categorization libraries that can rapidly analyze massive repositories of data, documents, and other artifacts, which will help enterprises more easily discover, classify, and protect sensitive data stored within cloud applications such as Microsoft Teams, Slack, Google Workspace and more.\"\u00a0</em></p>\r\nHanzo Spotlight+ is a data intelligence layer that helps users visualize data, offering large enterprises the scalability necessary to manage early case assessment of collaboration data efficiently. The AI-powered data enhancement automates the detection of PII, toxicity, unwanted behaviors, and more.

By providing quick and accurate messages and file intelligence of collected content, enterprise legal teams have the information necessary to support internal investigations or ediscovery matters.\r\n\r\n<img style=\"height: auto;max-width: 100%;width: 432px;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto\" src=\"https://1687478.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/1687478/Product%20Marketing/product_images/illuminate/HANZO_Illuminate-Graphic_Vertical_Web.png\" alt=\"HANZO_Illuminate-Graphic_Vertical_Web\" width=\"432\" height=\"682\" />\r\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Illuminate your data journey.</strong> From start to finish, better data insights = better decisions.</h5>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px\"><em>\"Enterprises across many industries are accelerating the adoption of collaboration applications.

This figure represents growth in adoption of iManage Cloud by existing and net new customers. Organizations supported the needs of their knowledge workers, to provide a secure environment, a modern user experience and advanced collaboration capabilities to enable them to work productively in a blended work environment. Additionally, this growth demonstrates iManage\u2019s ability to easily scale its business operation in tune with market requirements. In 2022, all customers onboarded are running on sustainable energy that is 98% more carbon efficient than on-premises workloads.\r\n\r\niManage\u2019s market leadership is across regions and market segments. 80% of the Global 100 and 77% of the AM Law 100 law firms, alongside 37% of the Fortune 100 organizations, are iManage customers. In EMEA, 87% of the top 100 European law firms use iManage. In the UK, 92% of the top 50 are iManage customers. Furthermore, the annual ILTA Technology Survey 2022 highlights the legal technology community's ongoing and substantial preference for iManage across corporate enterprises and law firms in every market segment. Globally, the trend of law firms with under 50 lawyers selecting iManage as their preferred document management platform, continued too.\r\n\r\nThis growth is recognised also independently by business software peer-to-peer review website, G2.com, who names iManage a Leader in six categories including \u2018Momentum Leader\u2019 and \u2018Highest User Adoption Enterprise\u2019 categories.\r\n\r\niManage maintained its cloud leadership through continued investment in iManage Cloud, closely collaborating with Microsoft to leverage Azure.

The introduction of the \u201cTask List\u201d in the <a href=\"https://imanage.com/products/tracker/\">iManage Tracker</a> task management application, is an example.\r\n\r\nTo support the achievement of the company\u2019s priorities, in 2022, iManage significantly invested in R&amp;D to the tune of 21% of revenue.\r\n\r\n\u201cDespite the uncertainties that dominated 2022, we maintained our singular focus on addressing the needs of our customers,\u201d said Neil Araujo, CEO, iManage. \u201cUnderlying all customer priorities was providing a secure and advanced cloud service that delivered the best possible user experience so that the environment that professionals worked within was as frictionless as possible.\u201d\r\n\r\nFrom an organizational perspective, iManage\u2019s global workforce grew by 7% across all aspects of the business, with diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) being a core strategy. The company continued its commitment to sustainability, as the organization plays its part in helping to address the global climate change challenge.\r\n\r\nLooking to the imminent future, Araujo concluded, \u201cThe real promise of the \u2018future of work\u2019 is the ability to easily adapt working practices to take advantage of new business opportunities and make better business decisions. So, from this year and beyond, our focus is on the \u2018mastery\u2019 of the cloud.

    "social_media_description": "<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.priorilegal.com/\">Priori Legal</a>, the leading legal marketplace for in-house legal teams, is proud to announce it received the New Law Company of the Year award at the 2023\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.law.com/legaltechnews/2023/03/20/the-2023-legalweek-leaders-in-tech-law-awards-winners-are-here/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Legalweek Leaders in Tech Law Awards</a>. The New Law Company of the Year award highlights the power of Priori\u2019s technology, particularly its new outside counsel decision-making platform, Scout, which received the award, and the industry-changing difference the company is making in using data to change how outside counsel resourcing decisions are made. Additionally, Priori was\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.priorilegal.com/blog/priori-finalists-2023-legalweek-awards\">named as a finalist</a>\u00a0in three other categories, including Legal Operations, Championing Diversity in Tech and Innovators of the Year for Priori Co-Founder and Chief Product Officer Mirra Levitt.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cWe\u2019re honored to be recognized as New Law Company of the Year,\u201d commented Basha Rubin, CEO and Co-Founder of Priori. \u201cIn-house teams make outside counsel hiring decisions without the benefit of robust data, which can lead to unsatisfactory results, slow progress on diversity and higher costs. We\u2019re excited to provide a technology platform that improves the process for in-house legal departments with both our Scout and Marketplace products, and gives law firms access to the right opportunities. Our clients are finding new ways to solve their legal problems and save on costs and this award emphasizes that success.\u201d</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The New Law Company of the Year award comes on the heels of a\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.priorilegal.com/blog/priori-milestones-2022-rapid-growth\">year of growth for Priori</a>. In 2022, its flagship Marketplace product grew its Fortune 100 client base by over 50% and expanded its reach to 70 countries, saving those global companies 40-75% on average compared to other outside counsel options. Priori also implemented its award-winning product, Scout, across many corporate legal departments, including Hearst, Marsh McLennan and Zimmer Biomet. Scout onboarded 45 law firms, including five of the AmLaw 15 and nearly 25% of the AmLaw 100. Hearst anticipates Scout will save their legal department 325 hours annually.</p>",

It\u2019s not uncommon for evidence to include texts, emails, direct messages, and other digital content. Electronic discovery, also known as eDiscovery, involves sorting through potential terabytes of information within a case to find relevant information.\u00a0</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0</span>\r\n\r\n<span data-contrast=\"none\">The size of eDiscovery can change depending on the size and scope of the case. On average, a U.S. civil case will contain over 130 gigabytes of information. To put that into perspective, 3 GB of information is required to stream a film in HD on a streaming service like Netflix for an hour. That means that the average eDiscovery for a civil case is the same amount of information as streaming a film in HD for almost two days straight.</span>\r\n\r\n<span data-contrast=\"none\">It can be difficult to sift through the piles of emails, databases, and documents involved in eDiscovery, and it only gets more complicated if the documents are in another language.

The software completes time-intensive work and automatically goes through data investigation, file indexing, virus scanning, and translation. The software does this through various applications and processes, preparing documents for discovery almost instantaneously.\u00a0</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0</span>\r\n\r\n<span data-contrast=\"none\">Once the information is uploaded, translated, and cataloged, legal teams can begin reviewing the data. Because the information is digital and has been indexed by the\u00a0</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">eDiscovery software</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">, it is easy to search and sort through information using metadata fields. This helps legal teams quickly find information relevant to the case. It also does the critical job of allowing teams to quickly remove files or documents that are not relevant to discovery.\u00a0</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0</span>\r\n\r\n<span data-contrast=\"none\">SYSTRAN helps with\u00a0</span>\u00a0<span data-contrast=\"none\">multilingual eDiscovery</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">. With a continually growing global economy, it\u2019s not uncommon for cases to involve documents, programs, or files that need to be translated. Rather than adding even more time to the eDiscovery process to deal with translating each document, SYSTRAN can translate and manage digital files as part of the discovery process. This automated translation helps legal teams save time and find relevant information even if documentation was created in a different language.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0</span>\r\n<h2><span data-contrast=\"none\">How Does\u00a0eDiscovery\u00a0Work With SYSTRAN?</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">\u00a0</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:40,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0</span></h2>\r\n<span data-contrast=\"none\">SYSTRAN uses a machine translation solution. That means we go beyond just word-for-word translation, using a mix of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and human experience to create a revolutionizing\u00a0eDiscovery service.\u00a0</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0</span>\r\n\r\n<span data-contrast=\"none\">Translating with AI helps tackle complex tasks while still considering the nuances and subtleties involved with translation. This only becomes more complex with eDiscovery because there is a wide diversity of inputs, document size, sentence structure, and even grammatical correctness to\u00a0take into account.</span>\u00a0<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0</span>\r\n\r\n<span data-contrast=\"none\">For example, it can be easy to translate a sentence like, \u201cAre you home yet?\u201d into other languages because it is a full sentence. But how do you deal with a short-handed text where someone texts, \u201cu home\u201d? There\u2019s no subject. There\u2019s no object. No punctuation even shows that it\u2019s a sentence. It\u2019s a single letter and a noun, so how can that be translated? That\u2019s where machine learning comes into play.\u00a0</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0</span>\r\n\r\n<span data-contrast=\"none\">Machine learning allows programs to learn and develop beyond their initial programming. Traditional translation software acts like a language-to-language dictionary. If the program encounters the word \u201chola,\u201d it searches the databases and translates it to \u201chello.\u201d This works great for formal writing, but what happens when people misspell, use incorrect grammar, or abbreviate?\u00a0</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0</span>\r\n\r\n<span data-contrast=\"none\">For basic translation programs, they can\u2019t translate if a word isn\u2019t in their established dictionary. But that\u2019s where machine-learning AI makes a difference. Machine learning takes those unique, abnormal situations and uses them to expand beyond its original programming.\u00a0</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0</span>\r\n\r\n<span data-contrast=\"none\">The first time a machine learning translation software encounters an abbreviation like \u201cpq,\u201d it might have a hard time translating it. It has no direct translation. It doesn\u2019t even look like a word, so it can be a struggle to translate. However, once the AI learns that \u201cpq\u201d is an abbreviation for \u201cpor que,\u201d it\u2019s automatically added to the dictionary database. It will quickly translate \u201cpq\u201d to \u201cwhy\u201d the next time it\u2019s encountered.\u00a0</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0</span>\r\n\r\n<span data-contrast=\"none\">With machine learning, the more translation a program is used in, the more experienced it becomes.

    "short_description": "The Evolution of Technology in Plaintiff Law Firms: Enhancing Personal Injury Cases through Automation and Innovation",
    "social_media_description": "Plaintiff law firms can benefit significantly from the automation of various processes and tasks. Automation can streamline operations, increase efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance the overall effectiveness of the firm.\r\n\r\nIn today's world, technology is fundamentally reshaping the way personal injury cases are prepared, argued, and resolved. Plaintiff law firms, in particular, are reaping significant benefits from the automation of various processes and tasks.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>The Role of Technology in Personal Injury Cases</strong>\r\n\r\nRecent technological advances are altering the landscape of personal injury cases, revolutionizing the legal strategies employed by attorneys and medical professionals alike. From evidence gathering to expert testimony, technology has become an indispensable ally. Its impact is profound, extending to insurance premiums, settlements, and the ultimate outcomes of personal injury cases.\r\n\r\nTechnology is not just a tool. It's a driving force behind how personal injury cases are argued, won, and decided.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Gathering Evidence: A Technological Imperative</strong>\r\n\r\nOne critical aspect of this technological transformation is the use of automated tools for gathering evidence. These tools allow attorneys and their clients to access elusive facts, data, and information that can make or break a case.\r\n\r\nArtificial intelligence (AI), in particular, has revolutionized evidence analysis, witness tracking, and legal argumentation. The infusion of data-driven insights has bolstered the accuracy of risk assessment and streamlined settlement negotiations.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>Streamlining Operations through Automation</h3>\r\nThe benefits of automation extend beyond evidence gathering and court filings. Plaintiff law firms can significantly streamline their operations through automation, resulting in improved efficiency and reduced costs. Some of these benefits include:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2><strong>Document Management:</strong></h2>\r\nAutomation tools streamline time-consuming tasks like document review, data entry, and case management. This frees up staff time to focus on critical aspects of their work, such as legal research and strategy.\r\n<h2><strong>Document Generation:</strong></h2>\r\nAutomated document generation and review tools expedite the creation and review of legal documents, including contracts, pleadings, and briefs.\r\n<h2>Cost Reduction:</h2>\r\nBy automating routine tasks, plaintiff firms can reduce their reliance on manual labor and administrative staff, leading to cost savings. Smaller or single-office firms can handle a higher caseload more efficiently.\r\n<h3>Enhanced Client Service:</h3>\r\nAutomation leads to faster response times, better communication, and improved client service. Satisfied clients are more likely to refer new clients and provide positive reviews.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>Popular Automation Tools for Plaintiff Law Firms</h2>\r\nMany plaintiff law firms have adopted automation software\u00a0 to assist in organizing and managing case files, deadlines, and client information more effectively. Improved organization fosters better communication and coordination within the firm and with clients.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.litify.com/\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Litify:\u00a0</strong></a></h3>\r\nLitify is a comprehensive legal practice management software.

Filevine's emphasis on customizable workflows allows firms to create tailored processes that align with your unique requirements. Its analytics and reporting features provide insights that can aid in making informed decisions and improving case management strategies.\r\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.clio.com/\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Clio:</strong>\u00a0</a></h3>\r\nClio is a cloud-based practice management software offering a range of features, including case management, time tracking, billing, document management, and client communication.

The platform connects and unifies all document input sources and integrates with downstream systems to optimize and automate document processing workflows.\r\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.proofserve.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">Proof:</a></h3>\r\nProof is a platform that focuses on client communication and collaboration. It provides tools for secure client messaging, document sharing, and collaboration within a protected environment. Proof can facilitate secure communication channels between attorneys and clients, allowing for the efficient exchange of sensitive information, case updates, and documentation.

This innovative system ensures that ECF notices are downloaded, profiled according to firm naming conventions, stored in your preferred DMS or file system, and distributed to all relevant parties \u2013 all without human intervention.\r\n\r\nThe alternative is manual handling of ECF notices, which comes with inherent downsides: including errors, risks, and duplicative efforts. Multiple individuals accessing and downloading the same documents independently leads to increased costs, lack of control, and inefficiencies.\r\n\r\nAutomation of this process reduces risk, enforces firm knowledge management guidelines, and supports timely calendaring. The resulting ECF notice management is centralized, controlled, fast, fully automated, customizable, and 100% accurate.\r\n\r\nECFX Notice integrates with your existing solutions and manages multiple storage locations across departments and locations \u2013 including your preferred CMS, DMS, file repositories, and shared folders (on-prem and cloud) \u2013 while ensuring complete consistency and accuracy.\r\n\r\nAutomation is reshaping plaintiff law firms, offering a multitude of benefits. It's not merely a technological option, but a necessity in today's legal landscape. By embracing automation, plaintiff law firms can enhance their efficiency, reduce costs, and, most importantly, provide better service to their clients, ultimately leading to improved outcomes in personal injury cases.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nLean into automation, and\u00a0<a href=\"https://info.goecfx.com/schedule-a-demo?hsCtaTracking=e7142821-b145-4cc2-ad26-e2d3fed9a989%7C419a4fd8-980a-4a8c-83c2-c3f2fc13aa1c\">request an ECFX Notice product demo today</a>.",

Specifically, ECFX takes this opportunity to address the\u00a0<strong>memorandum issued by the Administrative Office of the United States Courts\u00a0</strong>and the\u00a0<strong>Standing Order of the Eastern District of North Carolina, R.E. \"</strong><a href=\"https://19759129.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/19759129/23-SO-3%20(003)%20(002).pdf\"><strong>Third-Party Services and Access to Case Information and Documents</strong></a><strong>\"</strong><strong>\u00a0</strong>in which the court states:\r\n\r\n<em>\u201cIt has come to the attention of this Court that certain registered users of the Court's CM/ECF system may be using third-party service providers (including, but not limited to PACER Pro, DocketBird, CourtDrive, and RECAP) to collect and organize case filings. To facilitate the use of such a third-party service, these CM/ECF users either designate the third-party service provider as a secondary recipient of Notices of Electronic Filing (NEF) or Notices of Docket Activity (NDA), or share their PACER account credentials with the service provider. The thirdparty service provider then may download and manage documents on the CM/ECF users' behalf, and in some instances resell or republish case documents and case information that they obtain.\u201d</em>\r\n\r\nWe built ECFX to be an extension of your law firm's secure environment,\r\nnot a public library.\r\n\r\nAt ECFX, we fully support the federal courts' commitment to upholding the confidentiality of sealed documents and private information.

The automation of high volume/low-value repetitive tasks \u2013 the kind which no one involved relishes performing \u2013 is a strategy that has been widely adopted by law firms and corporate legal departments alike, and is well-proven to be effective in delivering operational efficiencies that result in lower costs and superior outcomes.\r\n\r\nIt no longer makes sense for law firms to continue to process electronic court filing (ECF) notices manually when these time-consuming, cumbersome, error prone, and typically non-billable tasks can be automated.\r\n\r\nThe benefits of ECF notice automation for firms of any size are quantitatively and qualitatively significant in terms of (i) reduced cost (with fast ROI); (ii) risk mitigation; (iii) enforcement of firm policies; (iv) better data quality; (v) better visibility into resource needs and allocation; and (vi) improved partner and employee morale.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.theedgeroom.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ECFX-Whitepaper.pdf\">Click to download the whitepaper</a>.",

Your starting place is a traditional website that informs clients\r\nabout your legal practice and the lawyers that work there. From that starting place, you want to\r\nincorporate the following best practices to maximize the efficiency of your online marketing.\r\n<h2>HIGHLIGHT YOUR SPECIALTY PRACTICE AREAS</h2>\r\nWhen trying to find a lawyer, the average person doesn\u2019t need general\r\nlegal advice. They need legal assistance for a specific problem. This is why\r\nyour website should highlight the areas you specialize in. Include your\r\nlaw specialty in the tags for your website, in the opening paragraph, and\r\nregularly throughout the page.\r\n<h2>2. USE MULTIPLE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS</h2>\r\nIn addition to a website, you want your online presence on various social\r\nmedia platforms. Most people use only one or two types of social media\r\nin their daily life. Every platform where you aren\u2019t present reduces the\r\naudience that is likely to discover your law office. Even if you only use a\r\nsocial media site minimally, providing links to your website will increase\r\ntraffic.\r\n<h2>3. PUBLISH A FAQ</h2>\r\nApproximately 0.36% of the population has a law degree. The rest have a\r\nvery limited <a href=\"https://1seo.com/digital-marketing-services/legal-digital-marketing/\">understanding of the law</a> and are certain to have questions.\r\nBy publishing a FAQ to your website, you are providing an easy way for\r\npotential clients to find exactly the information they are looking for, even\r\nwithout direct contact.\r\n<h2>4. PUBLISH REGULAR AND ENGAGING UPDATES</h2>\r\nOne of the best ways to drive traffic to your website is to update it regularly.\r\nWebsites with new content receive a bump in Google ratings and are more\r\nlikely to appear on the front page of web results. Additionally, information\r\nthat is interesting to your clients will encourage them to visit your website\r\nmore regularly.\r\n<h2>5. TAKE ADVANTAGE OF GOOGLE</h2>\r\nRoughly 50% of mobile searches are for local services. In order to maximize\r\nyour visibility on local searches, you need to register your practice with\r\nGoogle+ Local. This will provide Google Maps information for your law firm\r\nand ensure that your law firm.\r\n<h2>6. SUBMIT TO LAW DIRECTORIES</h2>\r\nWebsites in the first five search results receive roughly 50% of web traffic\r\nand websites on the first page receive 95%. Do a search for legal services.\r\n<a href=\"https://1seo.com/seo-services/legal-seo/\">Law directories</a> always appear in the sponsored results near the top of\r\nthe first page. Thus, even if your business doesn\u2019t appear on the first page,\r\nif you can be found in a law directory, there is a greater chance of being\r\nfound by a\r\nnew client.\r\n<h2>7. OPTIMIZE YOUR WEBSITE FOR MOBILE</h2>\r\nAs of 2022, 63% of all Google searches were performed on mobile and\r\nthat number has consistently increased throughout the past decade. Any\r\nwebsite needs to be mobile friendly in order to be useful. Any investment\r\ninto getting your website optimized for mobile will definitely pay off in the\r\nlong run.\r\n<h2>8. USE TARGETED ADVERTISING</h2>\r\nAdvertising dollars need to be spent as efficiently as possible, which\r\nmeans targeting the right demographics. You want your ads to be seen\r\nby people who are most likely to need the specific services you offer. For\r\nexample, if you specialize in <a href=\"https://1seo.com/seo-services/legal-seo/\">estate law</a>, you want your ads to be viewed by\r\nolder individuals. You can specify target demographics when purchasing\r\nonline advertising and you should.\r\n<h2>9. COMBINE YOUR EFFORTS WITH OTHER ATTORNEYS</h2>\r\nEven if you don\u2019t work together, it is valuable to create online \u201calliances\u201d\r\nwith other attorneys. This is an excellent way to get referrals when clients\r\nneed practices areas allied attorneys don\u2019t provide, and all you need to\r\ndo is return the favor. Including links to their practice <a href=\"https://1seo.com/social-media-marketing/legal-social-media/\">on your website</a> (and\r\nin return have them link to your website) will also improve your Google\r\nrankings, due to having quality backlinks.\r\n<h2>10. MAKE SURE YOUR WEBSITE LOOKS PROFESSIONAL</h2>\r\nClients expect professionalism from lawyers and that goes for <a href=\"https://1seo.com/website-design-services/legal-website-design/\">your website</a>\r\nas well. If your website looks like it was designed by an amateur, potential\r\nclients are likely to immediately leave your page. Hire a professional to\r\ndesign your website and provide regular maintenance.\r\n<h2>11. MAKE YOUR WEB PAGE EASY TO NAVIGATE</h2>\r\nThe average person spends an average of 2 minutes and 17 seconds\r\nnavigating a website. That means you have to engage with them quickly.\r\nHaving an easy to navigate website is a big part of that. The faster visitors\r\ncan find the information they are looking for, the more time they will spend\r\nactually interacting with that information.\r\n<h2>12. LEVERAGE POSITIVE REVIEWS</h2>\r\nAccording to data from Reevoo, conversion rates increase by roughly 50%\r\nbetween a website with no reviews and one with 10 reviews. Conversion\r\nrates continue to consistently improve as more reviews are added. You\r\nshould leverage this by rewarding clients for providing reviews. Since you\r\nchoose which reviews go on your website, it doesn\u2019t matter whether they\r\nare positive or negative.\r\n<h2>13. INCLUDE A CALL TO ACTION ON YOUR FRONT PAGE</h2>\r\nA call to action offers two major benefits. First, it engages potential clients\r\nwith an activity as soon as they arrive at your website. Should they call you\r\n\r\nor fill out a survey? You let them know. Second, it gives visitors easy access\r\nto your contact information. Both of these benefits increase the conversion\r\nrate of your website.\r\n<h2>14. USE OPT-IN MARKETING</h2>\r\nSimilar to how a call-to-action lets your clients know how best to contact\r\nyou, opt-in marketing lets your clients easily tell you how it is best to\r\ncontact them. They choose what types of marketing to receive and how to\r\nreceive it, via text, e-mail, etc. Studies also show that opt-in marketing has\r\na much higher conversion rate than opt-out marketing.\r\n<h2>15. USE OPT-IN MARKETING</h2>\r\nDue to the area of law you practice, you expect a specific demographic\r\nto frequent your website. For example, if you provide family law, you\r\nexpect parents will mostly browse your website. In that case, you should\r\ninclude links on your site that are useful for parents, even if they are\r\nonly tangentially related to the law. Providing extra value for your key\r\ndemographic improves conversion rates.",

    "social_media_description": "<h1>Effective Strategies for Legal Firms to Generate Positive Reviews</h1>\r\nIn 2014, a staff member at <a href=\"https://1seo.com/\">1SEO</a> encountered a family incident that serves as a cautionary anecdote for legal companies. His spouse's vehicle was struck from behind while stopped at a traffic signal, resulting in damage to the rear bumper. Initially devoid of any pain, she proceeded with her day but subsequently encountered stiffness and soreness. She chose to take a bath and aspirin instead of seeking medical treatment.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, on the following day, she experienced considerable discomfort in her neck and back, which posed difficulties in carrying out her usual activities. Nevertheless, she proceeded to her workplace, where a colleague proposed seeking legal advice from a lawyer, specifically a nearby attorney familiar to her colleague's son.\r\n\r\nShe consulted with this lawyer, who proposed to represent her on a contingency fee basis, guaranteeing a settlement within a year. Despite his assurance of regular updates, he failed to fulfill this commitment. Gradually, her efforts to communicate with the lawyer were met with vague replies or complete absence of reaction. After almost six years since the accident, her case was finally brought to arbitration. Currently, she is composing a scathing evaluation of her encounter with the lawyer and his company, with the intention of sharing it extensively on the internet.\r\n\r\nThis narrative underscores the significance of online reviews for legal establishments. Adverse evaluations can have an enduring influence, and companies must regard them with gravity. As a digital marketing business that focuses on the legal sector, we stress the need of lawyers being vigilant about online feedback, particularly unfavorable reviews, and taking steps to resolve any underlying problems.\r\n\r\nHere's three primary approaches for obtaining reviews for legal services:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>Solicit Reviews Directly:</strong> Clients frequently require a nudge to provide feedback. It is beneficial to request contented clients to share their experiences, providing them with guidance on the specific details to include and the appropriate platforms to publish on.</li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Ensure Visibility on Review Platforms:</strong> Legal firms should have profiles on sites like Avvo, FindLaw, and Lawyers.com, not just for drawing new clients but also for gathering reviews. If these profiles are adjusted for SEO, they can help improve online visibility.</li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Aim for exceptional customer service:</strong> Although it is not feasible to satisfy every individual, constantly delivering outstanding service might result in favorable feedback. Even in difficult circumstances, a company's exertion can have an impact on the comments they receive.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWithin the highly competitive <a href=\"https://1seo.com/digital-marketing-services/legal-digital-marketing/\">legal services industry</a>, reviews wield substantial influence over a firm's reputation and ability to attract new clients. It is imperative to actively pursue favorable reviews and swiftly and efficiently handle any unfavorable ones. It is important to keep in mind that even if clients leave, <a href=\"https://1seo.com/blog/do-local-google-reviews-help-your-seo/\">their reviews</a> will always be present and will continue to influence the internet reputation of your organization.",

    "short_description": "The Importance Of Personal Branding For Your Legal Practice",
    "social_media_description": "<h1 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">The Importance Of Personal Branding For Your Legal Practice</h1>\r\nHuman interactions are based on connections - favorable ones attract you, while unfavorable ones create a strong desire to avoid a person or organization at any expense.\r\n\r\nThis is an inherent aspect of human behavior, and it remains constant and unalterable. Advertisers possess a profound comprehension of this notion, as they invest significant resources in terms of time and money in doing research and market analysis to ascertain customer preferences and aversions, as well as the extent to which consumers link enjoyment with engaging in a particular product or service.\r\n\r\nThrough consistent and flexible branding across several platforms, this method attempts to improve an organization's standing in the marketplace.\r\n<h2>Common Branding Errors for Law Firms</h2>\r\nAlthough marketing a product or service consistently is a key method for establishing a brand, it is not the only means of doing so. A brand primarily relies on name recognition, reputation, the perception of your target market, and your position within the industry as a whole.\r\n\r\nLegal consumers have more options than ever before in the digital environment we live in. In virtually every location across the country, there is an abundance of lawyers, and individuals may easily access an extensive roster of legal professionals online within a matter of minutes. Consequently, if you fail to differentiate yourself from the average lawyer, there is a possibility of becoming overshadowed and unnoticed.\r\n<h2>What is the precise definition of \"personal\" branding?</h2>\r\nTo exemplify the impact of personal branding on<a href=\"https://1seo.com/ppc-services/legal-ppc/\"> legal professionals</a>, ranging from individual local practitioners to large-scale national law firms, let us consider a specific case:\r\n\r\nBoth personal injury attorneys in this case are equally successful and highly sought-after by their respective clients. However, one individual is recognized for their exceptional skill in bargaining, and the other is well regarded for their vast expertise in litigation pertaining to injuries. While they work in the same field, their notable attributes set them apart from one other and contribute to their individual reputations.\r\n\r\nWhile numerous attorneys affiliated with a <a href=\"https://1seo.com/seo-services/legal-seo/\">larger law firm</a> may recognize the significance of this, they may regard it as irrelevant due to being included by their organization's own \"brand identity.\" Although attorneys may garner significant respect within their firm and from clients, their exposure outside of these spheres may be limited. Personal branding has a crucial role in that context.\r\n\r\nA strong personal brand enables<a href=\"https://1seo.com/digital-marketing-services/legal-digital-marketing/\"> lawyers to expand their network</a> and accomplish their professional objectives, such as increased community involvement, attracting more clients to their company, or establishing themselves as authorities in their field of expertise.\r\n\r\nThere is a comprehensive list of digital marketing strategies that your legal company can utilize. In fact, we have already discussed six of the most crucial ones. Currently, our aim is to redirect our attention towards the less tangible resources necessary for constructing a personal brand, with the initial step being some self-reflection.\r\n\r\nAlthough it may be difficult to maintain objectivity when assessing one's own strengths and flaws, it is crucial for attorneys to objectively review their abilities. Evaluating your exceptional strengths, areas that want growth, and the desired reputation you aim to establish are all factors to take into consideration. This personal inventory extends beyond mere credentials, degrees, or alma maters.\r\n\r\nWhile these are important to you as a professional, having a strong drive for achieving results and maintaining a consistent and well-known online (and offline) presence establishes a high level of trust and positive reputation with your clients, distinguishing you from the numerous anonymous legal representatives.\r\n\r\nResponses to inquiries regarding what distinguishes you and motivates you to achieve are not about transforming yourself into somebody you inherently are not. The key is to prioritize authenticity and project the most exceptional rendition of oneself as a consummate professional and trusted legal advisor.\r\n\r\nSeek the guidance of bona fide experts in branding and marketing.\r\nThe concept of \"branding\" encompasses various components that collectively contribute to the overall concept.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it is crucial to have a deep understanding of the fundamental aspects of efficiently establishing connections and communicating with both new and existing clients. This is essential for creating a distinctive impression, fostering a productive relationship, and fostering a favorable association.",

With Scout\u2019s AI launch, legal teams can unlock even more valuable data and insights about their trusted law firm relationships and elevate their decision-making processes for outside counsel hiring, law firm panel management and rate reviews.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cAI is profoundly changing the way legal professionals work,\u201d commented Basha Rubin, CEO and Co-Founder, Priori. \u201cUsing AI to power Scout allows for a more seamless integration of in-house and law firm data, including better search and matching. These capabilities empower companies to find the best legal talent for their need at that moment with minimal friction, taking administrative tasks off of our users\u2019 plates and freeing them up to spend more time on strategic tasks that deliver business value.

    "short_description": "Law Firm Scorecarding Explained \u2013 Best Practices and Tips for Success",
    "social_media_description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Most legal departments deal with huge amounts of data every day. From e-billing platforms to compliance software to internal documents to public data sources, the issue faced by legal teams isn\u2019t where to find data but where to find the\u00a0<em>right</em>\u00a0data.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For making decisions about outside counsel spending, easily accessing actionable data is a challenge for even the largest legal departments. According to the Thomson Reuters\u00a0<em><a href=\"https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en-us/posts/legal/legal-department-operations-index-2023/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2023 Legal Department Operations Index</a></em>, only 9% of legal departments have outside counsel management processes that are \u201cpredictive\u201d and include forecasting and benchmarking of performance.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.acc.com/sites/default/files/2023-06/ACC_2023_LDMB_Report_Executive_Summary.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">largest companies spending over $130 million per year on outside counsel</a>, it\u2019s clear there is a huge opportunity for legal operations professionals and in-house counsel to make a business impact with better outside counsel management processes. One common way large legal departments achieve this is through law firm scorecarding. In this article we\u2019ll take a look at scorecarding, explaining what it means in the legal department context, its benefits and best practices.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">WHAT IS LAW FIRM SCORECARDING?</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For legal departments, law firm scorecarding is simply a systematic approach to something that in-house counsel and legal operations professionals are already doing: Analyzing outside counsel performance. Instead of an endeavor that individual legal team members undertake separately using their own rubrics, scorecarding operationalizes the process of reviewing law firms and attorneys, setting standard categories and measurements on which to judge them.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">THE BENEFITS OF LAW FIRM SCORECARDING</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The overall goals of law firm scorecarding should align with your legal department\u2019s business goals. Maybe those are larger goals such as cost savings, increased efficiency and better results or maybe they are smaller-scale goals such as retaining institutional knowledge or building more consistent processes. The Association of Corporate Counsel\u2019s (ACC) Value Challenge Tool Kit Resource,\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.acc.com/sites/default/files/resources/advocacy/valuechallenge/toolkit/709546_1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\u201cHow to Formally Evaluate Outside Counsel\u2019s Performance to Improve Service,\u201d</a>\u00a0explains some of the key benefits of scorecarding:</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Increased Consistency.</strong>\u00a0Formalizing law firm reviews through a scorecarding process ensures that firms are measured in a consistent way across all members of the legal department. The review data collected about a law firm through scorecarding is much more valuable because it can be compared apples-to-apples with every firm the company works with.</p>\r\n<strong>Managed Expectations.</strong>\u00a0Being able to explain the specific ways your legal department grades law firms helps outside counsel understand what you\u2019re looking for and how they\u2019re being judged. When it comes time for rate negotiations, scorecarding provides a consistently applied objective standard that shows outside counsel how they performed.\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Retained Knowledge.</strong>\u00a0Systematically reviewing outside counsel creates a database of knowledge about the law firms your legal department works with. That information is carried forward even if individual relationships are lost.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Standardized Cycle of Reviews.</strong>\u00a0Scorecarding serves as a reminder for legal operations professionals and in-house counsel to reflect on and review outside counsel relationships. It ensures that important information about successful (and failed) matters is kept. It also helps to gather feedback from all team members who interact with the law firm, which can sometimes be overlooked without an operationalized review process.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">WHAT DOES A LAW FIRM SCORECARD LOOK LIKE?</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One of the most important elements of a scorecard is its design. While the underlying data is what will drive decision-making and improve your legal department\u2019s processes, without the right design that data will be hidden and, ultimately, useless.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Legal departments can perform law firm scorecarding effectively with everything from a bare-bones spreadsheet to a bespoke, top-of-the-line tech implementation. In thinking about design, the general goal is to create something that surfaces important data points clearly and can be understood at a glance.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here are a few tips on format that we learned while building the scorecarding function for our outside counsel decision-making platform,\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.priorilegal.com/blog/scout-an-outside-counsel-platform-to-supercharge-your-data-with-ai\">Scout</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>A Picture Is Worth a Thousand Words:</strong>\u00a0It\u2019s obvious but true\u2014make your scorecard visual wherever possible. Clean and crisp visual representations of data increase efficiency because your team will spend less time poring over documents and more time making decisions.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n \t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Highlight the Important Information:</strong>\u00a0Put number labels on design elements like bars or stars so users aren\u2019t left guessing exactly what the measurement is. Similarly, use up and down arrows to indicate increases or decreases compared to historical data or benchmarks. Just like the point above, the more you can add to make the data quickly understandable, the more time your team will have for decision-making.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n \t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Keep It Simple:</strong>\u00a0Minimize the amount of explanatory text and, if possible, include all of the relevant information on one page. If a one-page format is too limited, consider creating an \u201cexecutive summary\u201d version of the scorecard and include additional pages or tabs to collect the supporting details.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">TIPS FOR CREATING CATEGORIES</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To create an effective scorecard, you need to thoughtfully choose the categories you\u2019re going to judge law firms by. When doing this, it helps to keep in mind general principles for measuring performance. Whether you use something like the SMART (or Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Time-related) goal-setting framework or another method, thinking about the ways you want to measure performance and making sure you can communicate and keep track of those categories will ensure your scorecard performs its purpose.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We worked with our legal department clients to build law firm scorecarding into Scout and learned about what worked well (and what didn\u2019t) along the way. Here are a few tips for creating effective categories for your scorecard:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Evaluate quantitative and qualitative measures.</strong>\u00a0You\u2019ll want a mix of both to capture the fullest picture of your outside counsel. Quantitative examples include spend, forecasting performance, time to invoice, staffing ratios, use of AFAs, case or matter outcomes, conformance with outside counsel billing guidelines and diversity statistics. Qualitative examples include things like how happy in-house attorneys are with the firm, proactive strategic and/or industry insights provided by the firm and pro bono or CLE opportunities.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n \t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Encourage objectivity and data-based assessment.</strong>\u00a0For qualitative measures (e.g., innovation or creativity measures), create a scoring system.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n \t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Focus your data categories on metrics that drive your decision-making process.</strong>\u00a0Limit your scorecard to three to six categories if possible and avoid summarizing all of the data you have about a law firm.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n \t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Include different levels of benchmarks</strong>\u00a0(e.g., all firms, comparable firms and by cohort based on experience, expertise, etc.).</p>\r\n</li>\r\n \t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Include an overall or composite score</strong>\u00a0that is weighted based on key metrics in your categories. This creates a shorthand for quick comparison.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">NEXT STEPS FOR LAW FIRM SCORECARDING</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Now that you\u2019ve decided which data categories you\u2019re including in your scorecard and what it looks like, how do you start using it and ensuring it helps your legal department achieve its goals?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The most important first step is to incorporate your scorecard into your existing workflows. Collecting metrics and populating the scorecard is a huge win, but if you\u2019re not using it to make decisions it\u2019s not going to have the impact you want it to. It is also important to establish a regular reporting cadence that fits in with your workflows and business needs. This ensures that the data doesn\u2019t become stale and it also helps as a reminder to review the results from scorecarding in your other processes.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We have found that many legal teams, especially those in large legal departments operating on the cutting edge of the industry, are moving away from manual, static processes using spreadsheets into tool-based reporting options. If the time it takes to build, compile and execute a law firm scorecarding strategy is holding your legal department back, looking to legal technology to offset that time and energy expense could be the right option.</p>\r\nIf you\u2019re curious about how our outside counsel decision-making platform, Scout, not only helps legal teams build a scorecard but also manage outside counsel relationships and structure unorganized data using artificial intelligence,\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.priorilegal.com/scout#subscription-form\">schedule a demo with our team</a>\u00a0to learn more.",

    "short_description": "Alternative Career Paths for Attorneys: Navigating a World of Opportunity",
    "social_media_description": "<h2>A Q&amp;A with Matt Wheatley, VP of Client Development at Priori</h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Matt Wheatley, VP of Client Development at\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.priorilegal.com/about-priori-legal\">Priori</a>, has a unique perspective on alternative career paths for attorneys: Not only did he take one himself, starting his career practicing law and eventually moving into legal staffing and now business development at Priori, but he has also spent years working with attorneys and helping them pursue paths outside of the traditional model. In this Q&amp;A, Matt shares some career advice for legal professionals looking to explore all of their options and reflects on his experiences as a practicing and nonpracticing lawyer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The traditional legal career path can be limiting for many people, but it\u2019s also a known quantity so it feels safe to follow. Looking back at your experience in law school, how do you think people can start to explore alternative legal career paths?</strong></h4>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I think the reality is a lot of 22-year-olds are not thinking intentionally about law school. I went to law school because it seemed like the next logical step. Now, with the experience I have, there are a few things I would say that potential law students should do.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We should take a page from what most people who get their MBA do: They get real-world practical experience before they apply to go to business school. There are existing paths for people to take that approach in the legal industry. You can be a paralegal. There are programs for people who have just graduated, typically from top-notch undergrads, to go and work at the top firms and get a couple of years of experience while they decide whether or not to go to law school.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While that may not be feasible for the kid who went to University of Kentucky, like me, or another big state school that may not have the prestige to draw an offer from a big firm out of undergrad, there are other options too. You could work in a local law firm which very likely could be a litigation practice and you\u2019ll get to see what that looks like.</p>\r\nAnd, increasingly, there\u2019s an opportunity to work as a legal operations professional out of school. For example, getting a job as a legal ops coordinator at a medium or large-sized company that is starting to think more intentionally about how they run their legal department. Another option is to work at a legaltech company like Priori. Our Attorney Network team has been a feeder to lots of great law schools. They\u2019re interacting with lawyers and getting to see what their life looks like and their quality of life and earning potential.\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And, ultimately, you may find you don\u2019t want to go to law school. You can be a legal operations professional or a corporate paralegal and make a great living just by staying on that path. So you can be in legal with or without your law degree.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>You started off on a traditional legal career path but then went an alternative route. What made you pursue that path?</strong></h4>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I almost went to work at a big legal recruiting firm right out of law school. But one of the people I met there during the recruiting process gave me some advice and said that I should take the opportunity to get some practice experience. He didn\u2019t want me to jump into recruiting and a few years later be wondering whether I would have been happier as a practicing lawyer. At the time, I didn\u2019t really care about being a practicing lawyer; I just wanted to live in New York. But I took that advice to heart even though I didn\u2019t want to and I practiced for about a year and a half after law school.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I kept in touch with the person who gave me that advice and eventually they reached out again to revisit the conversation. As a lawyer, I wasn\u2019t unhappy\u2014I was doing some interesting things\u2014but I still wanted to move to New York and I was in a better place financially and with my personal relationships to make the move. I certainly didn\u2019t know that I was moving into something that could be just as fulfilling as a legal career can be, but I got lucky. I also ended up working under someone who was a fantastic mentor and boss and I was surrounded by other great people at the company.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What brought you to Priori?</strong></h4>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Working in legal staffing around that time, in 2017, was a far cry from what it is today. It wasn\u2019t as widely accepted in the legal industry and it was still growing. But by 2019, things were really taking off and people in the legal industry were thinking more about how to get work done more efficiently without adding headcount or sending work to large law firms. It started to click for me\u2014what I was doing wasn\u2019t legal staffing, it was helping people and law departments get work done more efficiently at better rates using different models than they previously had access to.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I started to nerd out on this idea and I wanted to be part of something on the cutting edge of this new environment, particularly something that was tech-enabled. I saw how technology was revolutionizing all of these different industries but it wasn\u2019t as dominant in the legal world. That\u2019s when I found Priori and reached out to Basha [Rubin, Priori CEO and Co-Founder,] on LinkedIn. She didn\u2019t respond immediately, but by the time she shot me a message back I had seen more of the news about Priori growing and raising money. I met with her and the rest of the team and decided to join the company.</p>\r\nMy move to Priori was kind of the first intentional move of my career. I thought, there is a ton of opportunity in this space and these people are really smart. I\u2019m really thankful for the experience that I serendipitously gained at my previous job and how it forced me to grow because that set me up perfectly to be a part of Priori.\r\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What has been the biggest surprise for you in taking an alternative career path as an attorney?</strong></h4>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The biggest surprise for me is being at Priori and seeing that there is so much opportunity in the legal industry that\u2019s not just following this traditional path that I had always looked for in the past. That path was: top law school, top law firm, in-house experience and available for 40-plus hours a week dedicated to a company.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">What has been super motivating for me at Priori is to see that there are so many different paths that you can take in this industry that you don\u2019t see every day. You might not see them on LinkedIn or when you\u2019re looking at the background of the general counsel at a Fortune 500 company or an AmLaw 50 law firm partner.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can go to a Big Law firm, you can get in-house experience and then you can hang up a shingle and be a solo practitioner and make really good money for yourself using the skills that you\u2019ve learned. You can not go to a Big Law firm; you can not go to a law firm at all. You can start a data privacy consulting firm. You can go straight in-house at a tech company and start negotiating commercial contracts. If you can find the right niche and develop the right expertise, there is an opportunity for you to do really well.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There\u2019s no path you have to follow, despite how it sometimes seems in the industry. You\u2019re not doomed if you\u2019re not following exactly what you\u2019ve been told you need to follow because of the pristine examples that you\u2019ve seen in the upper echelons of the industry. That\u2019s been motivating for me working at Priori and seeing people who have taken those paths and helping to facilitate those paths. I have the opportunity to do that in a way I never would have in my previous role and certainly not as a practicing lawyer.</p>\r\n<em><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-wheatley-288146a2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Follow Matt on LinkedIn</a>\u00a0for more insights into legal industry careers, how technology is changing the legal industry and much more.

    "social_media_description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Increasing investment in legal technology shows no signs of slowing down. In the Association of Corporate Counsel\u2019s (ACC)\u00a0<em><a href=\"https://www.acc.com/2023-legal-technology-report-house-legal-professionals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2023 Legal Technology Report</a></em>, 78% of the respondents called legal technology a \u201cmust-have\u201d and\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/5-legal-technology-trends-changing-in-house-legal-departments\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2022 research from Gartner</a>\u00a0predicted technology will make up 12% of the average legal department\u2019s budget by 2025. And while legal technology offerings like contract lifecycle management and e-billing often top the lists of most-used technologies, more and more legal departments are looking to\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.legaldive.com/news/legal-spend-management-tools-onit-apperio-priori/641102/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">outside counsel management tools</a>.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">That\u2019s why we created an innovative outside counsel decision-making platform that empowers legal teams to make more confident hiring decisions when it comes to their outside counsel, preferred panels and law firm relationships.\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.priorilegal.com/scout\">Scout</a>\u00a0uses artificial intelligence (AI) to do the heavy lifting to collect, structure and analyze law firm data, allowing legal operations professionals and in-house counsel to spend more time assessing key information and making decisions that provide ROI.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">HOW DOES IT WORK?</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Scout uses AI to quickly collect and analyze data from disparate sources, structuring it in a way that makes it easily searchable and digestible. For legal departments dealing with the growing pains of managing unstructured data, Scout can take that data in its current disorganized state, organize it and make it actionable.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After structuring the data, Scout puts all of the key information corporate legal departments need to make outside counsel decisions at their fingertips. The platform centralizes data in an intuitive user interface, making it easy to search, track, and review everything you need to make the right decision, whether that is information on expertise, experience, performance, locations, certifications (e.g., diversity) or anything else.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">WHY BETTER OUTSIDE COUNSEL DATA MATTERS</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Better data improves decision-making. This has been known in the business world for years. The largest companies in the world use data to make decisions that create more value, from\u00a0<a href=\"https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/data-driven-decision-making\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">determining where the next Starbucks location should be to improving training programs for Google employees</a>.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Whether your legal team is in the initial stages of leveraging data for better decision-making or you already have a robust process, improving your outside counsel and legal services provider data makes an immediate impact on the business. Over\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2022/08/17/2500029/28124/en/Global-Legal-Services-Market-Expected-to-Grow-from-713-12-Billion-in-2021-to-998-73-Billion-in-2026-at-a-Rate-of-6-97.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$700 billion is spent every year on legal services</a>\u00a0across the globe and, chances are, a significant chunk of that legal spend could be optimized if the legal operations professionals and in-house counsel responsible for it had more insight into their options.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">BENEFITS OF \u201cDECISION-GRADE\u201d OUTSIDE COUNSEL DATA</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Legal departments at companies as large as the Fortune 10 use Scout to take their outside counsel data and make it \u201cdecision-grade.\u201d What does that mean? It means by structuring outside counsel relationship data and bringing it into one intuitive platform, legal teams can confidently align their hiring and legal spend decisions with their organization's goals, and spend less time doing it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The benefits of using Scout to make your data \u201cdecision-grade\u201d include:</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Centralizing key information about outside counsel relationships.</strong>\u00a0Law departments can get as granular as they like with data points, including combining information from billing systems, expertise and experience data, internal reviews and more. All of this data is searchable for law department users in Scout\u2019s easy-to-use interface.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Clearly surfacing impactful data, such as performance reviews.</strong>\u00a0Scout enables and tracks internal reviews of attorneys and firms, presenting them in a clear visual interface that can be understood at a glance. Additionally, users can build their own structured review process in the platform, ensuring important performance data is recorded at regular intervals, preserving institutional knowledge and improving future decision-making.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Quickly finding best-fit firms for new matters.</strong>\u00a0Being able to compare factors such as expertise, location, rates, past performance and any other data points that are important to your legal team means you don\u2019t have to go digging through spreadsheets and disparate systems to find the right provider for your next project. Beyond optimizing legal spend, companies can also align their hiring with important internal initiatives (e.g., finding law firms with diversity or environmental certifications).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">THE IMPACT OF BETTER OUTSIDE COUNSEL DECISION-MAKING</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Large companies use Scout to achieve their outside counsel hiring goals. As an early adopter, Hearst\u2019s legal department finds that the platform helps them \u201cmore quickly and effectively identify the attorneys it needs for external legal work,\u201d according to\u00a0<em><a href=\"https://www.legaldive.com/news/hearst-outside-counsel-decisionmaking-priori-buying-legal-council-scout-legal-technology/636727/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Legal Dive</a></em>. In addition to finding the right fit for their new matters, Hearst also uses it to bolster other legal department initiatives, such as their outside counsel rate review process and diversity, equity and inclusion goals. The team also found that implementing Scout saved them an estimated 325 hours annually\u2014roughly two months of work for a full-time employee.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And, while cost savings were not the primary goal of their Scout implementation, both An Trotter, Senior Director of Operations in Hearst\u2019s Office of the General Counsel, and Jessica Williams, former Senior Operations Manager (who recently moved to FanDuel as Director of Legal Team Strategy and Operations), agreed that it\u2019s helpful for that goal. \u201cThe sooner you\u2019re getting lawyers on a case and the sooner you\u2019re getting them integrated into that case, the better your end results are going to be,\u201d Williams explained.</p>\r\nIf you\u2019re curious how you can supercharge your outside counsel data collection and analysis project with an AI-enhanced platform like Scout,\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.priorilegal.com/scout#subscription-form\">request a demo</a>.",

With the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the eDiscovery landscape has undergone a significant transformation. Traditional approaches to document review are giving way to AI-powered solutions that promise unprecedented accuracy, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. In this blog post, we delve into the latest frontier in eDiscovery: Artificial Intelligence.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">eDiscoveryAI: A Game-Changer</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The legal industry has been no stranger to technological advancements, but AI represents a seismic shift. Powered by sophisticated Large Language Models (LLMs), AI is revolutionizing how legal professionals handle eDiscovery. These LLMs are engineered to understand and generate human-like text, making them invaluable in tasks like document review, privilege logs, and more.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The eDiscoveryAI Advantage</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">eDiscoveryAI, our cutting-edge solution, harnesses the potential of LLMs to redefine eDiscovery. It's not just a tool; it's a transformative force in the legal world. Here's how it's reshaping the eDiscovery landscape:</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li><b> Unmatched Accuracy and Efficiency</b></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">eDiscoveryAI review boasts precision rates as high as 96%, and recall rates as high as 98% ensuring that no relevant document goes unnoticed. This means you won't miss a single relevant document. Say goodbye to time-consuming manual document review processes. With AI, you gain unparalleled accuracy and efficiency in identifying crucial information.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ol start=\"2\">\r\n \t<li><b> Streamlined Document Review</b></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Traditional predictive coding tools are no match for the precision and speed of AI. eDiscoveryAI automated document review, reducing the time and resources required. It's like having a tireless team of experts at your disposal, ensuring that no stone is left unturned.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ol start=\"3\">\r\n \t<li><b> Customization</b></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Every legal case is unique, and eDiscoveryAI recognizes that. It's highly customizable, allowing you to tailor it to your specific project or case requirements. From creating distinct issues to setting relevance criteria, you have the power to adapt AI to your needs.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ol start=\"4\">\r\n \t<li><b> Seamless Integration</b></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">eDiscoveryAI seamlessly integrates with existing eDiscovery platforms like Relativity. This means you can leverage AI's benefits without overhauling your current systems. It's about enhancing your workflow, not disrupting it.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ol start=\"5\">\r\n \t<li><b> Early Case Assessments and More</b></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">AI isn't just about document review. With eDiscoveryAI, you can conduct early case assessments, detect foreign languages, review images and audio files, and even train your CAL model. It's a comprehensive solution designed to cover all your eDiscovery needs.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Why AI, and Why Now?</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The legal landscape is evolving faster than ever. Clients demand more efficient and cost-effective solutions. Staying competitive means embracing AI in eDiscovery. Waiting on the sidelines isn't an option.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">eDiscoveryAI is your ticket to the future of eDiscovery. It's about efficiency, accuracy, and staying ahead of the curve. With AI as your ally, you're not just catching up with the latest trends; you're leading them.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Conclusion</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In the legal world, the future is AI-powered. eDiscoveryAI represents the latest frontier in eDiscovery, where innovation meets necessity.

Now, contract reviewers can easily make edits, comments, or redline using Docubee\u2019s intelligent contract automation product.</p>\r\nDocubee has already streamlined the entire contract lifecycle, including the way businesses create, manage, sign, and track digital contracts, and now it has added collaboration to its tool stack. The new module allows internal and external reviewers to easily view, edit, and redline contracts collaboratively and in real-time.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Collaborate module eliminates the typical back-and-forth that comes with contract negotiations, and makes the redline process straightforward and secure,\u201d said Steve Willson, President at Docubee. \u201cDocubee users benefit from the seamless experience with a simplified contract lifecycle that translates to faster close rates.\u201d\r\n\r\nCollaborate\u2019s easy-to-use, Word-like interface streamlines internal cross-team collaboration, enabling commenting, editing, and redlining; as well as negotiation with external users who can view and add suggestions in real-time.

Its flexible functionality enhances any contract process, and it easily scales with team or law firm growth.\r\n\r\nCollaborate is a part of the Docubee all-in-one contract automation platform which consists of five other key solutions:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>Gather</strong>: Collecting information to incorporate into contracts and agreements.</li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Generate</strong>: Creating contracts swiftly through templates, artificial intelligence (AI), or by creating and editing from scratch.</li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Share</strong>: Routing contracts seamlessly for editing, review, and approval.</li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Sign</strong>: Capturing secure, compliant, and legally binding signatures on any device.</li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Integrate</strong>: Connecting to the systems teams use daily or building Docubee\u2019s tools into native applications using APIs.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nFor more information about Docubee and its full offering of intelligent contract automation solutions, visit <a href=\"https://www.docubee.com/products/\">www.docubee.com/products</a>.\r\n\r\n<strong>About Docubee</strong>\r\n\r\nDocubee, an Accusoft brand, is an intelligent contract automation platform that lets businesses create, manage, sign, and track digital contracts in one secure platform.

In speaking with the Vice President of Operations, Greg Anderson, the message is clear:</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0\u201cOur mission is to create a platform that offers advanced features while remaining user-friendly and easy to learn.\u00a0 We concentrate our development efforts on providing intuitive, yet sophisticated, E-Discovery features and workflows. We recognize that a significant segment of the market is looking for an E-Discovery platform capable of handling complex tasks while reducing requirements for training, support overhead, and extensive change management efforts.\u201d\u00a0</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The most common first impression of the layout is that the user interface feels very familiar.

Regular AI training ensures everyone stays updated on the latest developments.\r\n<ol start=\"3\">\r\n \t<li><strong> DATA-DRIVEN INSIGHTS</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<strong>Instant Analysis</strong>: AI for legal documents can provide real-time insights from data that previously required extensive manual analysis.\u00a0This empowers faster, informed decisions.\r\n\r\n<strong>Proactive Risk Monitoring</strong>: AI analysis of contracts and documents can proactively detect risks, allowing preventative mitigation.\r\n<ol start=\"4\">\r\n \t<li><strong> CHANGE MANAGEMENT</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<strong>Addressing Hesitancy</strong>: Hosting regular workshops provides a venue for hesitant team members to gain familiarity with AI systems in a collaborative setting.

Whether it\u2019s document collaboration or scheduling client meetings, AI can bring efficiency to these tasks.\r\n\r\n<strong>Adaptive Systems</strong>: The beauty of modern AI is its adaptability. By connecting it with tools like CRMs or document management systems, it can learn and adapt based on historical data and user interactions.\r\n\r\nIntegrating AI is an ongoing journey requiring strategic planning, skills development, and a willingness to evolve. The payoff makes this effort invaluable for in-house productivity and insights. With thoughtful change management, AI transitions from an external tool to an intrinsic capability. Involvement and feedback from professionals is the key to ensuring the tech aligns with team needs. With meticulous implementation, AI becomes a seamless ally rather than a disruptive presence, propelling teams to new heights.\r\n\r\n<em>Want to learn more about how you can unlock the true potential of AI systems (including advanced prompting techniques)?

Litify is one of the award-winning companies selected\u00a0<strong>from more than 1,500 nominations</strong>\u00a0across over 12 different countries!\r\n<h2>Why was Litify selected?</h2>\r\nLitify offers a premier practice management solution for law firms and a modern enterprise legal management solution for in-house legal teams. Our configurable practice management solution delivers a personalized work experience for every case type and role within a law firm \u2014 all on one platform.\r\n\r\nOur solutions come complete with the capabilities law firms need, including matter management, document management and generation, intakes, timekeeping, and much more. Plus, the Litify platform is built on an open infrastructure, enabling firms to integrate and centralize their systems and data.\r\n\r\nThe platform's power lies in our real-time reporting and interactive dashboards, enabling law firms to run their practices more efficiently and drive better legal outcomes and client experiences. For full service law firms, Litify helps leaders to showcase matter progression and historical results to drive repeatable business based on performance rather than price. Plaintiff firms leverage Litify to streamline and automate intake and case workflows while using predictive analytics to pair their best attorneys with the highest potential value cases.\r\n<h2>What Litify CEO Curtis Brewer had to say:</h2>\r\nWe\u2019re pleased to accept the Overall Practice Management Solution Provider of the Year award from LegalTech Breakthrough again this year. This win signals that the industry continues to shift toward a unified platform strategy, where multiple applications are available through one platform \u2014 and one login.\r\n\r\nI continue to be impressed by our clients\u2019 growth and success after switching to a centralized solution like Litify.

The mission of their annual program is to conduct the industry\u2019s most comprehensive analysis and evaluation of the top technology companies, solutions, and products in the legal technology industry today.\r\n\r\n\u201cLitify is a powerful platform and novel business approach that helps to usher the industry forward into a new way of working. Practice management encompasses a broad umbrella of functions, however, even in the 21st-century firms rely on multiple point systems which results in silos, manual work, and non-automated data,\u201d said Bryan Vaughn, Managing Director of LegalTech Breakthrough Awards.\u00a0<strong>\u201cWith Litify, gone are the days of fragmented systems and rigid workflows. Litify has perfected the way to deliver software that\u2019s unique to each firm while still serving the needs of the broader industry.\u201d</strong>",

    "short_description": "davinci Patent AI Copilot Launch Press Release",
    "social_media_description": "Today, successful startup <a href=\"https://kili-technology.com/\">Kili Technology Inc.</a> officially launched <a href=\"https://www.getdavinci.ai/\"><strong>davinci</strong></a>, a new artificial intelligence (AI) technology tool which drafts patents and office action answers in a fraction of the time that manual methods require.\r\n\r\nPatent descriptions and office action answers have always been laborious and time-consuming, often requiring IP lawyers to spend dozens of hours drafting them. Pressure from corporate clients to work faster and smarter has made IP law firms place a new emphasis on technology automation. Enter davinci - the most highly performant and secure Patent AI copilot available.\r\n\r\n<strong>How davinci Works</strong>\r\nFor patent drafting, davinci ingests text and drawings such as claims written by the attorney, the invention disclosure, conversation(s) with the inventor, and prior arts to generate a robust, detailed patent and drawing description that fits the required style. IP lawyers can then edit davinci\u2019s draft based on their preferences.\r\n\r\nFor responding to office actions, davinci processes both the patent application and prior art cited by the examiner. The software evaluates the strength of the arguments and makes a recommendation to the attorney whether to counter them or refine the claims accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe davinci tool allows IP law firms to deliver better patent and office action answers\u00a0 dramatically and more efficiently with lower operational risk. Early adopters of davinci, a hand-picked group of top 100 IP law firms in North America and Europe, have reported major time savings of up to 50% with its assistance. davinci frees up IP lawyers\u2019 time to focus on more substantial legal work and better quality patents.\r\n\r\n\u201cAI-assisted drafting promises to assist patent professionals by removing some of the lower added value time spent drafting parts of a patent application. The ability to feed a set of claims, drawings, and background material into davinci and receive a fleshed-out specification is a significant time saver. This will enable patent professionals to spend more time with their clients to understand their business. In turn, a better understanding of a client\u2019s business results in more focused applications, and a more effective overall IP strategy.\u00a0 Quality of the output is an essential component of a successful AI-assisted drafting tool.\u201d - <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/louispierregravelle/\">Louis-Pierre Gravelle</a>, IP Expert and Partner at <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/bereskin-&amp;-parr/\">Bereskin &amp; Parr</a>.\r\n\r\ndavinci is a Microsoft Azure partner and operates on Azure\u2019s cloud infrastructure, which is universally trusted by law firms. Highly secure, davinci adheres to the most demanding security requirements including SOC II Type 2 and ISO 27001 certifications, as well as GDPR data privacy requirements. Highly confidential, davinci has a Zero Data Retention API, does not use clients\u2019 data for training purposes, and adheres to a strict data segregation policy.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe named davinci after enduring icon Leonardo da Vinci, the greatest inventor of all time in the realms of creativity, science and technology, to show our tremendous respect for the invention process and intellectual property,\u201d remarked <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/fxleduc/\">Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier (FX) Leduc</a>, co-founder and CEO of Kili Technology. \u201cThe davinci patent generation and prosecution software tool is a symbol of innovation, ingenuity, multidisciplinary thinking, and visionary foresight, which we believe Leonardo would have leveraged if he were alive today. It is time for IP to be revolutionized by data-driven AI tools like davinci, which are assertively driving the rapid pace of technology forward to meet the industry\u2019s rising demands for technology collaboration.\u201d\r\n\r\n<strong>Availability </strong>\r\ndavinci is currently inviting law firms in North America and Europe to join the davinci <a href=\"https://www.getdavinci.ai/waitlist\">waitlist</a> to deploy the technology, which is by invitation-only for the next several months.\r\n\r\ndavinci will be demonstrating its Patent AI Copilot and meeting with law firms and media at ALM\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.event.law.com/legalweek\">Legalweek New York 2024</a> conference from January 29 - February 1 at the New York Hilton Midtown (booth#1224).\r\n\r\nFor more information about davinci or to apply for joining the waitlist, visit <a href=\"https://www.getdavinci.ai/\">https://www.getdavinci.ai/</a> or email contact <a href=\"mailto:thomas@getdavinci.ai\">thoma</a><a href=\"mailto:thomas@getdavinci.ai\">s@getdavinci.ai</a>.",

Both initiatives were developed by the ProSearch Linguistics, Analytics, and Data Science (<strong>LADS</strong>) team in collaboration with clients.\r\n\r\nProSearch\u2019s generative AI solutions for review are very effective because they bring practical value and time savings to the work of document review, assuring that reviewers can quickly understand the material and make informed, confident decisions.\r\n\r\n\"The LADS team is on fire with practical applications of generative AI,\u201d says Gina Taranto, director of applied sciences at ProSearch. \u201cAfter years of delivering solutions powered by deep learning and large language models, we are finding that generative AI supports new types of creativity and versatility for discovering and delivering insights. We\u2019ve just scratched the surface on these advances, and we\u2019re excited to take on more challenges in leveraging AI to support the conversion of complex legal data into deep knowledge.\u201d\r\n\r\n<strong>Identify and Manage PII with ProSearch Privacy Suite</strong>\r\n\r\nProSearch also announced the addition of a new user interface and dashboard in Privacy Suite, to help eDiscovery and compliance teams identify and address PXI in datasets. <a href=\"https://www.prosearch.com/solutions/data-privacy/\">ProSearch Privacy Suite</a> uses text and image classifiers to identify over 30 types of personal and private information to support eDiscovery redactions, DSAR request fulfillment, data breach response, and other privacy regulations.\r\n\r\nThe ProSearch team will be on-site at <a href=\"https://www.event.law.com/legalweek\">Legalweek</a> 2024 in New York, from January 29 to February 1.

With so much at stake, it\u2019s unsurprising that optimizing legal spend and controlling costs are among the highest priorities for legal departments. With this program, legal teams at companies of all sizes can access tools that allow them to analyze their current spend, track law firm performance and right-source legal work by sending it to the optimal provider.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">EARLY ACCESS PROGRAM</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Beginning February 15, 2024, legal teams and Priori Marketplace users can trial the new features free for six months by signing up for Priori\u2019s Early Access Program:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>RFP</strong>\u00a0\u2013 Send requests for proposals to trusted law firm panels and, if desired, simultaneously receive proposals from Priori Marketplace. Using this structured RFP process, legal teams can negotiate better terms and pricing with their law firms and select the right firm for a new project, whether from existing panel relationships or Priori\u2019s broader marketplace.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Reviews</strong>\u00a0\u2013 Leverage private, structured data reviews to better track law firm performance over time, providing legal teams with another key vector to inform and improve hiring decisions and align with company and legal department initiatives.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Scorecarding</strong>\u00a0\u2013 Easily and intuitively compare law firm performance through automated visual dashboards. Using this new feature, legal teams can track key performance metrics and use data to make informed decisions about future legal projects or matters.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Priori will highlight these three new features at Legalweek 2024 from January 29 \u2013 February 1.\u00a0 To learn more about these product enhancements and sign up for the Early Access Program, please visit\u00a0<a href=\"https://resources.priorilegal.com/early-access-priori-feature-lab\">the Priori website</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Rethinking Outside Counsel Management\u00a0</strong></h4>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Priori works with in-house legal teams at companies of all sizes to connect legal departments with the right outside counsel for projects globally, saving them time and money.

    "short_description": "Legalweek 2024 Recap: Empowering Legal Tech Innovation with Responsible AI &amp; Workflow Optimization",
    "social_media_description": "The fervor for the latest subjective technologies and qualitative insights dominated the spotlight at Legalweek 2024. Virtually every provider seemed to incorporate ChatGPT into their sales spiel or presentation.\r\n\r\nWell, that's not true. I'll confess, I couldn't resist purchasing a massager kit for my wife. There was a certain satisfaction for me in connecting with a fellow quick-minded sensory human amidst the whirlwind of futuristic virtual offerings.\r\n\r\n<strong>Responsible Use of AI</strong> was a pivotal theme at Legalweek 2024, reflecting the evolving landscape where AI technologies are increasingly integrated into legal workflows. It was difficult to pick which session had the most knowledgeable AI expert. I, most often, found the best conversations in the halls and at the various networking events. Experts stressed the significance of accountability in AI deployment, emphasizing the need for AI models to provide transparent sourcing of data summaries. This transparency ensures reliability and ethical usage, which is particularly crucial in legal contexts where the accuracy of information is paramount. Legal professionals were urged to prioritize AI solutions that uphold standards of accountability, enabling them to leverage AI for informed decision-making and strategy development confidently.\r\n\r\n<strong>Case Management Solutions</strong> emerged as a pressing concern, echoing the difficulties faced by law firms inundated with vast amounts of data. Most firms I spoke with shed light on the challenges of managing diverse data types and formats, often exacerbated by outdated project and matter management software. IT directors disclosed their increasing frustrations with the administrative burden imposed by legacy systems, highlighting the need for modern communication and classification tools. Moreover, the increasing volume of data storage necessitates comprehensive solutions capable of auto-classifying content and providing actionable insights into matter status and budget analysis. The call for <a href=\"https://www.knovos.com/solutions/legal/legal-matter-management/\">streamlined workflows</a> resonated strongly in my conversations, underscoring the urgency for integrated platforms that optimize efficiency and productivity while ensuring compliance with data retention policies.\r\n\r\n<strong>Controlling Risk with Workflow</strong> also arose as a central theme, reflecting the growing awareness of data management challenges and associated threats. I engaged in post-conference conversations, which unveiled the prevalence of data mismanagement, particularly in sensitive sectors such as public agencies. The real-life use cases uncovered the potential dangers of inadequate workflow management, emphasizing the need for proactive risk mitigation strategies. Technology was identified as a fundamental tool in preserving content integrity and trust, enabling organizations to implement robust workflow solutions that uphold <strong><a href=\"https://www.knovos.com/solutions/it/information-governance/\">data governance</a></strong> standards. By leveraging advanced technologies tailored to their specific needs, legal professionals can navigate regulatory complexities with confidence, safeguard sensitive information, and mitigate potential liabilities.\r\n\r\nOverall, my discussions with stakeholders during Legalweek 2024 consistently highlighted the remarkable capabilities of AI and its potential to enhance our efficiency as legal and technology professionals. We must diligently and meticulously construct and enforce the essential frameworks necessary for the optimal deployment of AI to ensure that its application propels the industry forward with integrity and responsibility at its core.\r\n\r\nImportant Note: The article is originally published on Knovos website.

Evidently, this is a double standard between humans and machines.</p>\r\n<p class=\"framer-text framer-styles-preset-spss6k\">Yet framed differently, what lawyers really care for is a tangible understanding of how this technology directly adds value to their workflow. Lawyers want to remain the decision-makers. If the technology demonstrably showcases human judgment as primordial, trust for adoption would become inevitable.</p>\r\n<p class=\"framer-text framer-styles-preset-spss6k\"><strong class=\"framer-text\">What advice do you have for young lawyers beginning their career?</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"framer-text framer-styles-preset-spss6k\">If you value interdisciplinary learning, legal tech is the perfect space. Building technology in the legal space is more about learning the psychology, cognitive/thought processes, and social practices of lawyers than the engineering itself.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"framer-1lnxw9q\" data-framer-name=\"Content 3\" data-framer-component-type=\"RichTextContainer\">\r\n<p class=\"framer-text framer-styles-preset-spss6k\">Please join us in welcoming Dr. Megan Ma to the Billables AI family!

    "short_description": "Oxygen Forensics CEO Lee Reiber looks ahead at the digital forensics landscape in 2025. Discover his insights on cloud and mobile forensics, AI and machine learning, the future of compromised media, and much more!",
    "social_media_description": "<section class=\"wysiwyg-editor\">\r\n<div class=\"grid-container\">\r\n<div class=\"grid-x grid-margin-x align-center\">\r\n<div class=\"cell medium-10\"><article>\r\n<h4>Read on for insights on the future of cloud &amp; mobile forensics, the role of AI and machine learning, and much more!</h4>\r\n<h1>CEO Lee Reiber: The Digital Forensics Landscape in 2025 -\u00a0<span class=\"color-sky-blue\">What Lies Ahead?</span></h1>\r\nDiscover the key trends transforming digital forensics in 2025, including advancements in cloud forensics, AI, mobile devices, deepfake detection, and cybersecurity convergence.\r\n\r\nAs we move towards 2025, the field of digital forensics is rapidly evolving, shaped by technological advancements, increasingly complex cyber threats, and ever-growing data volumes. The next few years promise a seismic shift in the way digital evidence is gathered, analyzed, and used in both criminal and corporate investigations. Below, I will explore key trends that are likely to define the digital forensics landscape in 2025 from my perspective.\r\n<h2>Cloud Forensics: Navigating the challenges of distributed data</h2>\r\nThe rise of cloud computing has significantly transformed the way data is stored, accessed, and shared. In 2025, cloud forensics will be even more complex, as data will increasingly be spread across multiple platforms, devices, and geographical locations.\r\n\r\nFor investigators, this distributed nature of data presents several challenges. Cloud providers\u2019 differing policies on data retention, encryption, and access rights will require forensics professionals to develop more nuanced approaches to acquiring digital evidence. The development of specialized tools for cloud data extraction and analysis will be crucial, as traditional forensic methods may not always be applicable in the cloud environment.\r\n\r\nBy 2025, we may see the standardization of cloud forensic tools and methodologies, supported by international legal frameworks that make cross-border data retrieval more efficient. Additionally, the integration of cloud forensics with other emerging technologies, like blockchain, may lead to more secure and transparent investigations.\r\n<h2>AI and Machine Learning: A game changer for digital investigations</h2>\r\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) will be at the forefront of the digital forensics\u2019 revolution by 2025. These technologies will dramatically enhance investigators\u2019 ability to process and analyze large volumes of data quickly and efficiently.\r\n\r\nCurrently, forensic examiners spend a significant amount of time manually reviewing data \u2014 whether it\u2019s logs, device contents, or network traffic. In 2025, AI-powered tools will take on much of this load, automatically flagging relevant information, identifying anomalies, and even making predictive assessments about potential leads.\r\n\r\nFor example, AI algorithms will help investigators uncover patterns in seemingly unrelated data, spot new cyberattack strategies, or predict the behavior of suspects based on digital footprints. The use of AI in predictive analysis will extend to identifying vulnerabilities in systems before an attack occurs, offering a proactive approach to digital security.\r\n<h2>Mobile Forensics: Keeping up with evolving devices</h2>\r\nAs smartphones and IoT (Internet of Things) devices continue to become more integrated into our daily lives, mobile forensics will become increasingly important. By 2025, new devices with advanced encryption and increasingly sophisticated operating systems will make extracting and analyzing data more challenging for forensic experts.\r\n\r\nTo keep up, forensic tools will need to evolve with the hardware. Advanced mobile forensics software will be capable of bypassing high-level encryption, recovering deleted files, and even extracting data from secure apps. With the advent of 5G networks, mobile forensics will also expand to include the ability to trace communications and data packets sent through these high-speed networks.\r\n\r\nIn addition, with wearable devices and smart home appliances generating massive amounts of data, digital forensic experts will need to refine their methods for capturing evidence from a wider range of IoT devices. This will require the development of new legal standards for data privacy and collection protocols, as IoT devices may store sensitive information.\r\n<h2>Media: The future of compromised media</h2>\r\nDeepfakes are becoming an increasingly significant challenge in digital forensics due to their potential to manipulate digital content \u2014 specifically video, audio, and images \u2014 at an unprecedented level of realism. In digital forensic investigations, deepfakes can pose a serious threat to the integrity of evidence. With advancements in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, creating convincing fake videos or audio recordings has become easier than ever. This makes it difficult for forensic investigators to distinguish between real and fabricated content, especially when these falsified materials are used in criminal activities such as defamation, fraud, or the dissemination of misinformation. Therefore, forensic investigators must develop advanced techniques to detect and analyze deepfakes to verify the authenticity of digital evidence.\r\n\r\nThe growing use of deepfakes also raises concerns regarding the security of digital communication channels. Forensic investigators must be equipped with tools that can identify subtle inconsistencies in video frames, audio frequencies, or pixel patterns that indicate manipulation. The use of deepfakes in cybercrime, such as in phishing schemes or identity theft, amplifies the need for digital forensics professionals to stay ahead of emerging technologies. As deepfake technology continues to evolve, forensic investigators will require specialized software and skills to spot and analyze these fakes, ensuring that they do not become a tool for criminal exploitation or a means of undermining the credibility of evidence presented in legal proceedings.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, deepfakes can be used to create false narratives in high-stakes legal or political cases. In the context of digital forensics, ensuring that deepfake materials are identified and excluded from investigations is crucial in upholding justice and maintaining truth in data. As the legal implications of deepfakes unfold, digital forensic investigators will play a central role in safeguarding against their malicious use. The ability to detect and prove the authenticity of digital evidence will be critical to upholding the integrity of investigations in an era where deepfakes are increasingly common.\r\n<h2>Cybersecurity and digital forensics convergence</h2>\r\nAs cyber threats become more sophisticated, the lines between cybersecurity and digital forensics will blur. In 2025, I expect digital forensics professionals to work more closely with cybersecurity teams to both prevent and investigate incidents. Real-time forensics will become more prominent, where digital forensics teams will be embedded within incident response teams to trace the source of breaches as they happen.\r\n\r\nThe integration of digital forensics with Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools will enable forensic professionals to analyze live network traffic and pinpoint malicious activity in real time. In turn, these findings can help shape future cybersecurity defenses.\r\n\r\nMoreover, as ransomware attacks, data breaches, and insider threats continue to rise, the need for coordinated efforts between digital forensics and cybersecurity experts will be essential. This convergence will lead to the development of hybrid roles, where professionals are well-versed in both fields, allowing for a more holistic approach to both crime prevention and investigation.\r\n<h2>Ethical considerations and privacy laws: Striking a balance</h2>\r\nThe explosion of digital data presents significant ethical challenges in digital forensics. By 2025, the collection and analysis of digital evidence will require careful consideration of privacy laws and ethical boundaries. Forensic professionals will need to ensure that they respect individuals\u2019 privacy while also securing vital evidence for investigations.\r\n\r\nNew laws and regulations governing data protection \u2014 such as the GDPR in Europe \u2014 are likely to become more stringent as data privacy concerns rise. Digital forensic experts will need to stay up-to-date with these changes, ensuring compliance while also making sure that investigations are not compromised. The development of clear guidelines for digital forensics in the context of evolving privacy laws will be crucial to maintaining the balance between law enforcement needs and individual rights.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, ethical debates surrounding AI-driven forensics, such as bias in Machine Learning algorithms, will likely become even more of a hot topic.\r\n<h2>Conclusion: A brave new world for digital forensics</h2>\r\nThe digital forensics landscape in 2025 will be characterized by an increasingly sophisticated and interconnected ecosystem of tools and technologies. From AI and Machine Learning to deepfake and cloud forensics, the future of digital investigations will be more efficient, precise, and data driven. However, as technology advances, so will the challenges\u2014both technical and ethical\u2014that digital forensic experts will face.\r\n\r\nAs I look ahead, one thing is certain: the digital forensics landscape of 2025 will be shaped not only by technological advancements but by the ability of professionals to adapt, innovate, and balance the need for justice with a complete vision of what the data says, either in favor or against \u2013 data does not lie when an investigator investigates and does not rely on only the tool. With the right tools, legal frameworks, and investigator training and competency in place, digital forensics will continue to evolve as a crucial pillar in the fight against cybercrime.\r\n\r\n</article></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</section><section class=\"cta-solid\">\r\n<div class=\"grid-container\">\r\n<div class=\"grid-x grid-margin-x align-center\">\r\n<div class=\"cell medium-10 large-6 text-center\">\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.oxygenforensics.com/en/contact-us/\">Contact us to continue this conversation\u00a0</a>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</section>",

    "social_media_description": "From March 24 to 27, LegalWeek 2025 will bring together thousands of legal leaders, technology experts and global providers in New York to discuss the most innovative trends in the sector. This year, Nymiz is proud to participate in this benchmark event, bringing our advanced data anonymization solutions to professionals interested in improving privacy and efficiency in their operations.\r\n<h2>Data privacy: A global challenge in the legal sector</h2>\r\nData protection regulations, such as the GDPR in Europe or the CCPA in the United States, have imposed new standards of security and transparency in the handling of information. However, non-compliance with these regulations remains a constant threat.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, cyberattacks, unauthorized access, and human error have led to a significant increase in fines for data breaches. For law firms, protecting their clients' sensitive information is not only a legal obligation, but an indispensable requirement to maintain their reputation and competitiveness.\r\n<h2>Our proposition: Advanced solutions to mitigate risks</h2>\r\nAt Nymiz, we understand that data privacy must be addressed from a strategic and operational perspective. Therefore, we offer advanced automated anonymization technologies, designed to:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Prevent human errors that can compromise information security.</li>\r\n \t<li>Minimize the risks associated with unauthorized access.</li>\r\n \t<li>Comply with privacy regulations without slowing down operational efficiency.</li>\r\n \t<li>Optimize legal processes, reducing costs and improving data protection.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWith our solutions, legal firms can transform privacy into a competitive advantage.\r\n<h2>Expanding into the US legal market</h2>\r\nFor Nymiz, the US legal market represents a key opportunity. Law firms, compliance departments and large companies are constantly looking for technological solutions to help them comply with local and international regulations. The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), along with other emerging state laws, has put even more pressure on data security and management in the country.\r\n\r\nParticipating in LegalWeek 2025 allows us to present our solutions to key industry leaders in the United States and explore strategic collaborations to drive innovation in privacy and data protection.\r\n<h2>Where to find us during LegalWeek?</h2>\r\nIf you attend LegalWeek 2025, you will have several opportunities to meet us:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Schedule a meeting with us during the event to explore how we can help you protect your data.</li>\r\n \t<li>Additionally, we would be happy to share insights on best practices in data privacy and LegalTech technology.

    "social_media_description": "<h1>The Critical Role of Mobile and Cloud Data Sources in eDiscovery: Unlocking New Frontiers in Legal Investigations</h1>\r\n<h2 id=\"ember49\" class=\"ember-view reader-text-block__heading-2\">Executive Summary</h2>\r\n<p id=\"ember50\" class=\"ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph\">In today\u2019s digital age, the rapid evolution of mobile and cloud technology has transformed how individuals and businesses communicate, store, and share information. With the proliferation of smartphones, tablets, and cloud-based storage services, these platforms have become essential sources of data for legal investigations. This white paper highlights the tremendous benefits of understanding and utilizing mobile and cloud data sources in the eDiscovery process, emphasizing how they enable more accurate, efficient, and comprehensive investigations for legal teams and organizations.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"ember51\" class=\"ember-view reader-text-block__heading-2\">Introduction</h2>\r\n<p id=\"ember52\" class=\"ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph\">eDiscovery (electronic discovery) refers to the process of identifying, collecting, and reviewing electronically stored information (ESI) for use in legal cases. Traditionally, eDiscovery focused on more conventional data sources, such as emails, documents, and hard drives. However, the explosion of mobile devices and cloud computing has introduced new challenges and opportunities for eDiscovery professionals.</p>\r\n<p id=\"ember53\" class=\"ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph\">The increasing volume, complexity, and significance of mobile and cloud-based data in litigation make it essential for legal teams to develop strategies to effectively manage and analyze these data sources. Failure to do so can result in missed evidence, costly delays, and legal ramifications. In this paper, we explore the reasons why understanding mobile and cloud data is vital to modern eDiscovery, and how embracing these sources can unlock significant benefits in legal investigations.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"ember54\" class=\"ember-view reader-text-block__heading-2\">The Rise of Mobile and Cloud Technologies</h2>\r\n<h3 id=\"ember55\" class=\"ember-view reader-text-block__heading-3\">Mobile Devices: The New Frontier of Data Creation</h3>\r\n<p id=\"ember56\" class=\"ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph\">Smartphones and tablets have become the primary, and often only, tool for communication, commerce, and information-sharing. With billions of users worldwide, mobile devices store vast amounts of personal and professional data, ranging from text messages and emails to app data, photos, videos, and location history.</p>\r\n<p id=\"ember57\" class=\"ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph\">Unlike traditional computer systems, mobile devices offer unique data sources\u2014such as GPS, accelerometers, and microphones\u2014that can provide crucial context for investigations. Legal professionals are increasingly turning to mobile data as a key source of evidence in cases related to criminal activity, corporate misconduct, and civil disputes. The advent of encrypted messaging services and app-based communication further underscores the importance of mobile data in today\u2019s legal landscape.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"ember58\" class=\"ember-view reader-text-block__heading-3\">Cloud Storage: Data at Scale and Across Borders</h3>\r\n<p id=\"ember59\" class=\"ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph\">Cloud computing has revolutionized how individuals and organizations store and access data. Services like Google Drive, Dropbox, and Microsoft OneDrive offer vast storage capacities, enabling users to store everything from documents and emails to databases and multimedia files. As businesses migrate their data to the cloud, eDiscovery teams must understand how to access, preserve, and review this data for legal purposes.</p>\r\n<p id=\"ember60\" class=\"ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph\">Cloud platforms also provide flexibility in terms of access, collaboration, and sharing, often across different geographic regions. However, this decentralization can complicate the identification of relevant data, particularly when the data is hosted by third-party service providers. Legal teams need to be equipped with the knowledge and tools to navigate cloud storage systems and retrieve critical data for investigation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"ember61\" class=\"ember-view reader-text-block__heading-2\">Benefits of Understanding Mobile and Cloud Data Sources</h2>\r\n<h3 id=\"ember62\" class=\"ember-view reader-text-block__heading-3\">Comprehensive Evidence Retrieval</h3>\r\n<p id=\"ember63\" class=\"ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph\">Mobile and cloud data sources provide a broader and more nuanced view of a case. For example, text messages, photos, or social media interactions stored on mobile devices can offer insights into a person\u2019s intentions, actions, and relationships\u2014information that traditional forms of eDiscovery may overlook.</p>\r\n<p id=\"ember64\" class=\"ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph\">Cloud data, such as shared documents, email histories, or project management activity, can reveal collaboration patterns, decision-making processes, and potential areas of corporate negligence or misconduct. By including mobile and cloud data in the eDiscovery process, legal teams can ensure a more complete and accurate picture of the evidence, increasing the likelihood of identifying critical facts.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"ember65\" class=\"ember-view reader-text-block__heading-3\">Improved Efficiency and Speed</h3>\r\n<p id=\"ember66\" class=\"ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph\">Incorporating mobile and cloud data into the eDiscovery workflow allows for faster data retrieval, processing, and analysis. Cloud-based tools enable rapid indexing, searching, and filtering of large datasets, helping eDiscovery teams to identify key information more efficiently.</p>\r\n<p id=\"ember67\" class=\"ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph\">Mobile devices and cloud storage often contain vast amounts of unstructured data, such as messages, images, and logs. With the right tools, this data can be quickly reviewed, reducing the time spent sifting through irrelevant information. As a result, legal professionals can focus on the most pertinent evidence, accelerating case timelines and reducing costs associated with manual review.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"ember68\" class=\"ember-view reader-text-block__heading-3\">Data Preservation and Compliance</h3>\r\n<p id=\"ember69\" class=\"ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph\">The growing role of mobile and cloud data in legal investigations has also highlighted the importance of data preservation and legal compliance. Proper handling of mobile and cloud data ensures that evidence is not inadvertently altered or deleted, which could impact the outcome of a case. Legal teams must establish protocols for data collection, preservation, and chain-of-custody to ensure compliance with legal and regulatory standards.</p>\r\n<p id=\"ember70\" class=\"ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph\">Moreover, understanding cloud data storage policies, service level agreements (SLAs), and privacy laws can help eDiscovery teams navigate the complexities of cross-border data transfers and jurisdictional challenges. A failure to comprehend these nuances could lead to violations of data privacy laws and affect the admissibility of evidence in court.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"ember71\" class=\"ember-view reader-text-block__heading-3\">Increased Accuracy and Reduced Risk</h3>\r\n<p id=\"ember72\" class=\"ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph\">A deeper understanding of mobile and cloud data sources reduces the risk of missing key evidence, misinterpreting data, or overlooking valuable information. By leveraging specialized eDiscovery tools and techniques designed for mobile and cloud platforms, legal teams can more accurately assess the relevance of data and its potential impact on the case.</p>\r\n<p id=\"ember73\" class=\"ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph\">For instance, analyzing geolocation data from mobile devices can provide crucial insights into a person\u2019s whereabouts at specific times, adding layers of context to witness testimony or alibis. Similarly, cloud-hosted collaboration tools may reveal conversations or documents that point to corporate fraud or misconduct. By incorporating these data points, legal teams can make better-informed decisions, increasing the likelihood of success in litigation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"ember74\" class=\"ember-view reader-text-block__heading-2\">Best Practices for Leveraging Mobile and Cloud Data in eDiscovery</h2>\r\n<h3 id=\"ember75\" class=\"ember-view reader-text-block__heading-3\">Adopt Specialized Tools and Technologies</h3>\r\n<p id=\"ember76\" class=\"ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph\">To effectively manage mobile and cloud data, eDiscovery professionals should invest in specialized tools that can automate data extraction, analysis, and review. Many platforms offer built-in mobile and cloud data capabilities, allowing legal teams to seamlessly integrate these data sources into their workflows. <a class=\"LoJdmTsykuKzNNXmKqlWKHuaZBApZAOCkc \" href=\"https://oxygenforensics.com/\" target=\"_self\" data-test-app-aware-link=\"\">Oxygen Forensics</a> products are the only all-in-one solution in the industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"ember77\" class=\"ember-view reader-text-block__heading-3\">Develop a Data Collection Strategy</h3>\r\n<p id=\"ember78\" class=\"ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph\">Establish clear protocols for data collection from mobile devices and cloud services. This should include a thorough understanding of the platforms being used, access points, and data preservation requirements. Legal teams should also be familiar with device forensic techniques and cloud data extraction methods to ensure that data is collected accurately and in compliance with legal standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"ember79\" class=\"ember-view reader-text-block__heading-3\">Stay Informed on Legal and Regulatory Changes</h3>\r\n<p id=\"ember80\" class=\"ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph\">As mobile and cloud technologies evolve, so do the laws and regulations surrounding data privacy, access, and cross-border transfer. eDiscovery teams must stay up to date on the latest legal developments to ensure that their practices remain compliant and defensible in court.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"ember81\" class=\"ember-view reader-text-block__heading-2\">Conclusion</h2>\r\n<p id=\"ember82\" class=\"ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph\">As mobile and cloud technologies continue to play an ever-larger role in both personal and business affairs, their significance in the eDiscovery process cannot be overstated. Legal teams that understand how to harness mobile and cloud data will gain a substantial advantage in their investigations\u2014helping to uncover critical evidence, reduce case timelines, and minimize risks.</p>\r\n<p id=\"ember83\" class=\"ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph\">By embracing these data sources, law firms and corporations can ensure more comprehensive, efficient, and accurate legal outcomes. In the increasingly digital world, mastering the complexities of mobile and cloud-based eDiscovery is no longer optional\u2014it is essential for achieving success in modern legal practice.</p>\r\n<p id=\"ember84\" class=\"ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph\">Lee Reiber, CEO - Oxygen Forensics, Inc.</p>",

    "social_media_description": "<a href=\"https://www.cloudficient.com/\">Cloudficient</a>, a leader in seamless information governance and eDiscovery solutions, introduces cutting-edge AI functionality to its flagship Expireon information governance platform. Expireon AI Studio is designed to mitigate eDiscovery review challenges and streamline data categorization, marking a significant transformation in corporate data management.\r\n\r\nExpireon AI Studio functionality allows enterprises to categorize email data at high volumes and separate low-value emails from relevant and sensitive or privileged emails. Users can prioritize what is promoted to the review platform and create dedicated work streams for reviewing and redacting sensitive messages before they are handed off to vendors or a law firm.\r\n\r\n\u201cOur new AI capabilities exemplify Cloudficient\u2019s mission to simplify complexity and help organizations reduce costs,\u201d says Peter Kozak, CTO of Cloudficient. \u201cNot only does this innovation reduce review volume by 40%, but users of Expireon AI Studio can be assured they\u2019ll achieve 95% or greater accuracy with minimal training effort.\u201d\r\n\r\nKey benefits include:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>Customer-Specific AI:</strong> Solutions are pretrained on synthetic data and refined quickly via customer data.</li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Data Autonomy:</strong> Solutions operate without GPUs, ensuring cost-efficiency and control.</li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Fast, Scalable Accuracy:</strong> AI achieves exceptional precision in weeks or months, reducing operational backlog and liability risks.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAvailable as an add-on to Expireon, AI Studio caters to organizations grappling with regulatory requirements and rising eDiscovery expenses.\r\n\r\nCloudficient also announces that Expireon\u2019s robust features for legal governance are expanding to support Microsoft Teams, SharePoint, Slack Enterprise Grid and OneDrive. Last year, the company announced its support for <a href=\"https://www.cloudficient.com/press-releases/cloudficient-expireon-expands-its-horizon-now-embracing-slack-for-legal-collection-and-compliance-archiving\">Slack</a> and a new <a href=\"https://www.cloudficient.com/press-releases/cloudficient-announces-expireon-professional-bringing-enterprise-level-data-sovereignty-and-ediscovery-to-the-mid-market\">professional offering</a>.\r\n\r\nCloudficient will offer live demonstrations showcasing how these AI advances address growing enterprise needs during Legalweek at booth 1305.",

    "social_media_description": "<a href=\"https://www.cloudficient.com/\">Cloudficient</a>, a leader in seamless information governance and eDiscovery solutions, announces the release of two new modules of its Foundational eDiscovery product suite\u00a0CaseFusion. Formerly known as CaseCrafter, the product suite delivers innovative eDiscovery process improvements on the left side of the EDRM. The new CaseFusion.Preserve\u00a0and\u00a0CaseFusion.Collect modules address challenges created by today\u2019s hybrid work environments and revolutionize the identification, preservation and collection stages of eDiscovery.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe digital transformation of collaborative environments has created challenges for legal teams that have relied on traditional custodian-based approaches to data preservation and collection,\u201d says Peter Kozak, CTO of Cloudficient. \u201cOrganizations are struggling with fragmented workflows, siloed information and increasing complexity when identifying custodians and preserving vital content. CaseFusion addresses these processes by offering a robust, holistic platform that empowers legal departments to manage growing data demands efficiently and cost-effectively.\u201d\r\n\r\nCaseFusion.Preserve simplifies and strengthens legal hold workflows. By integrating seamlessly with Microsoft 365, it allows organizations to preserve data in place while ensuring compliance with modern collaboration technologies. Enhanced workflows, such as interactive data maps, custodian interview scheduling and case timelines, enable better outcomes ensuring greater compliance from custodians working in today\u2019s collaborative technology landscape.\r\n\r\nCaseFusion.Collect\u00a0addresses the challenges of over- and undercollection using a data-driven approach to identify and extract electronically stored information. With capabilities like hyperlinked file preservation and activity-driven data mapping, organizations gain defensible, targeted collections that reduce costs without compromising completeness.\r\n\r\nCaseFusion helps organizations create a foundation for long-term legal excellence. By unifying HR, IT and business systems, organizations achieve an accurate custodian view and context-aware decision-making earlier in litigation. With flexible modules like CaseFusion.Identify, CaseFusion.Preserve and CaseFusion.Collect, legal teams are equipped for the complexities of managing scattered custodial data while laying the groundwork for future eDiscovery phases.\r\n\r\nCloudficient will offer live demonstrations of all the CaseFusion modules during Legalweek at booth 1305.",

    "short_description": "DeepJudge Unveils Legal AI Workflows \u2014 the First to Seamlessly Connect AI to the Full Scale of Firms\u2019 Internal Data",
    "social_media_description": "<h3>The company\u2019s law firm customers are building their AI strategies on DeepJudge, providing their AI apps and agents with instant, trusted institutional knowledge</h3>\r\n<b>Zurich, Switzerland, March 11, 2025 </b>\u2013 <b>DeepJudge</b>, the AI-powered legal search platform, today announced the launch of <a href=\"https://deepjudge.ai\"><b>AI Workflows</b></a>, a groundbreaking suite of AI agents and applications with instant, accurate access to all internal firm data. This marks a major leap forward in legal AI, enabling law firms to build AI-powered workflows that are deeply tailored to their specific needs\u2014without requiring firms to restructure or upload their data. Alongside this launch, DeepJudge is proud to welcome new customers, including Gunderson Dettmer, CMS Switzerland, and more.\r\n\r\n<b>Paulina Grnarova, CEO of DeepJudge</b>, commented: \"AI should work for you\u2014not make you work for it. Too many vendors require firms to \u2018clean up their data\u2019 before AI delivers value. That\u2019s not solving the problem, it\u2019s shifting the burden. But legal teams don\u2019t work with perfectly structured information, and AI shouldn\u2019t require it either. Like a human, AI must navigate fragmented, inherited, and unstructured data without adding extra work. DeepJudge rethinks retrieval from the ground up to handle real-world legal complexity.\"\r\n\r\nDeepJudge AI Workflows are built on top of the company\u2019s <b>powerful enterprise search engine</b>, developed by Grnarova, Kilcher, and Roth, all ex-Google AI researchers and PhDs in AI. Unlike traditional search, DeepJudge\u2019s platform <b>understands content, context, relevance, and institutional knowledge</b>, allowing legal professionals to instantly find and leverage their firm\u2019s collective expertise.\r\n\r\n<b>Nick Zaugg, Dispute Resolution Partner at CMS Switzerland</b>, emphasized this advantage: \u201cWhat sets DeepJudge apart is how quick and painless it is to leverage your firm\u2019s own knowledge base. Clients come to us for our past expertise, built up over years. That expertise lives in our documents, and so they are the essential starting point for our AI-driven client work product.\u201d\r\n<h3>AI Workflows: The Foundation for AI-Powered Legal Innovation</h3>\r\nDeepJudge\u2019s <b>AI Workflows</b> platform introduces:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><b>Built-in AI Workflows</b> that streamline legal tasks from search to action. The suite also includes workflows that leverage full access to prior work product, such as determining whether opposing counsel has previously agreed to a specific clause.</li>\r\n \t<li><b>AI Workflow Builder</b>, a low-code / no-code interface that allows firms to create custom AI-powered applications, multi-step workflows, and implement LLM agents.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<b>Joe Green, Chief Innovation Officer at Gunderson Dettmer</b>, highlighted the significance of search as the backbone of AI adoption: \u201cInstead of hunting for documents to upload to an AI platform, everything you need is already there. What excites me most is how DeepJudge search powers our AI strategy. Fast, efficient, and compliant access to the right information is the foundation for AI applications that help us do more with our knowledge base. With DeepJudge AI Workflows, we can connect LLMs and AI agents to everything we\u2019ve ever worked on\u2014unlocking entirely new possibilities.\u201d\r\n<h3>Why Legal AI Needs Enterprise-Grade Search</h3>\r\n<b>Yannic Kilcher, CTO of DeepJudge</b>, explained the <b>fundamental challenges of enterprise search</b> and why it forms the critical layer for legal AI applications: \u201cMuch of the work in building AI apps is handling the data integration, data governance and finding the right information for any query. Legal data is trapped in silos\u2014legacy databases, document management systems, SaaS platforms, and collaboration tools. Extracting and indexing this data, while maintaining security at scale, is the critical challenge of making Legal AI work. A search engine that does this doubles as both your critical tool for empowering your teams, and also as your intelligence layer for building and orchestrating apps and agents.\u201d\r\n\r\nDeepJudge\u2019s platform solves these problems by providing seamless integration with firm systems, respecting existing security and access permissions. This makes it a <b>critical tool</b> for AI adoption and allows for the <b>scalability</b> required for enterprise-level AI.\r\n\r\n<b>Oz Benamram</b>, a well-known legal innovation leader who has held senior roles at multiple Global 100 firms, emphasized DeepJudge\u2019s strategic importance: \u201cSince everyone will soon have access to all the public information in the world, what sets firms apart is their own private knowledge. To access our internal data for AI applications, we need a great search engine. DeepJudge is critical to achieving high-quality results for our AI innovation initiatives.\u201d\r\n<h3><b>Fully Transparent and Customizable Workflows for Generative AI</b></h3>\r\nDeepJudge\u2019s <b>AI Workflows</b> are fully transparent and customizable, allowing firms to not only access their data but also tailor AI outputs to meet their specific needs, creating maximum value. Catherine Kosten, Head of AI and LegalTech at <b>Homburger</b>, a leading Swiss law firm, noted, \u201cThe DeepJudge Workflow platform enables us to create AI applications tailored to our different departments, ensuring that AI adoption is driven by practical use cases. As Head of AI, I value the ability to develop workflows that directly address the needs of each team\u2014this flexibility is key to making AI truly useful across the firm.\u201d\r\n<h3>Trusted by Leading Law Firms</h3>\r\nThe company is committed to working closely with customers to refine and expand the product\u2019s capabilities. <b>Lenz &amp; Staehelin</b>, one of Switzerland\u2019s leading law firms, has played a pivotal role in shaping AI Workflows. \u201cSince launch, we\u2019ve seen a 90% adoption rate among our legal professionals,\u201d said Fedor Poskriakov from Lenz &amp; Staehelin. \u201cWe\u2019re using DeepJudge to help our team access crucial knowledge more efficiently, uncover insights with greater ease and deliver more value to our clients. It\u2019s helping us take our firm to the next level.\u201d\r\n\r\nDeepJudge will showcase AI Workflows in a <b>live customer webinar featuring Gunderson Dettmer on March 18, 2025</b>. Interested firms can <b>register to attend </b>at<a href=\"https://deepjudge.ai\"> https://deepjudge.ai</a>.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>About DeepJudge</b>\r\n\r\nDeepJudge is the core AI platform for legal professionals. Powered by world-class enterprise search that serves up immediate access to all of the institutional knowledge in your firm, DeepJudge enables you to build entire AI applications, encapsulate multi-step workflows, and even implement LLM agents. DeepJudge founders are ex-Google researchers with PhDs in AI from ETH Zurich and our leadership team has held senior roles at Thomson Reuters, Casetext, Agiloft and more. Our mission is to empower teams of lawyers to better harness their collective knowledge, enabling them to focus on the strategic aspects of their work.",

Safetyism fosters unrealistic expectations of risk elimination, making jurors more likely to punish corporations based on emotional reasoning rather than legal causation.\r\n<div id=\"awebChromeHelper\" data-version=\"1.24.2\">\r\n\r\nRecent cases, like Abel v. Lacks Beach Service and Cruz v. Allied Aviation, showcase how jurors\u2019 shifting attitudes about corporate responsibility and safety contribute to soaring damages. The research findings from IMS Senior Jury Consulting Advisor <a href=\"https://imslegal.com/team/jill-m-leibold-phd\">Jill M. Leibold, PhD</a> and Senior Jury Consultant <a href=\"https://imslegal.com/team/nick-polavin-phd\">Nick Polavin, PhD</a> on safetyism reveal key juror traits that predict pro-plaintiff verdicts\u2014including risk aversion, distrust of government agencies, and an inherent belief that corporations should \u201cdo more\u201d no matter the feasibility.\r\n\r\nTo combat these biases, defense attorneys must refine voir dire strategies to identify and remove safetyist jurors. Key tactics include targeted questioning on safety expectations, government distrust, and corporate influence, as well as effective cause challenges to exclude high-risk jurors.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding safetyism is critical for defense teams aiming to mitigate nuclear verdicts. Learn how to tailor voir dire and jury selection to counteract emotional decision-making in the courtroom.\r\n\r\nRead more: <a href=\"https://imslegal.com/articles/defense-voir-dire-safetyism\">https://imslegal.com/articles/defense-voir-dire-safetyism</a>\r\n\r\n</div>",

For transactional lawyers, contract reviewers, and in-house legal teams, this can help:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Reduce weeks of manual effort to mere minutes</li>\r\n \t<li>Improve contract negotiation efficiency and consistency in terms</li>\r\n \t<li>Mitigate risk by providing clear actionable guidance</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Issues List Generator \u2014 Optimize AI-Powered Contract Reviews</h3>\r\nThe Issues List Generator uses generative AI to review legal documents, extract critical issues, and categorize them based on a contract playbook. This tool is ideal for:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Creating checklists for negotiations or organizing topics for future analysis</li>\r\n \t<li>Ensuring accuracy and confidentiality</li>\r\n \t<li>Simplifying issue identification</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Deposition Prep \u2014 Elevate Litigation Readiness</h3>\r\nWith the Deposition Prep app, litigation lawyers and paralegals can instantly generate an outline to prepare for a deposition using planned exhibits, prior deposition transcripts, and case summaries. It helps teams:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Save time in reviewing lengthy documents</li>\r\n \t<li>Enhance deposition preparation</li>\r\n \t<li>Ensure no critical details are missed</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nLearn more and view additional use cases <a href=\"https://studio.netdocuments.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">in the ndMAX Studio</a>.\r\n<h2>A Flexible, Customizable Solution</h2>\r\nEvery legal team has unique workflows and requirements.

    "social_media_description": "A Benelux full-service law firm with an internationally oriented commercial practice, Stibbe\u2019s main offices are located in Amsterdam, Brussels and Luxembourg and the firm has branch offices in Dubai, Hong Kong, London, and New York City.\r\n\r\nStibbe\u2019s practice covers a wide variety of expertise, including corporate and finance, employment and pensions, energy, environment and planning, EU and national competition law, information technology, intellectual property, litigation and arbitration, public law, real estate and construction, and tax law. Its clients range from local and multinational corporations to public authorities and entities. Stibbe represents a broad range of activity including financial institutions (banking, investment funds, private equity), real estate, industry, retail, logistics, technology, media and telecommunications.\r\n<h3>Challenge</h3>\r\nThe legal system generates a massive and ever-increasing amount of data. Each new matter increases the data set that lawyers have to cope with in their work. It is surprising that until recently there has been little innovation in the way that the legal profession uses technology to stay informed and to help lawyers retrieve information efficiently.\r\n\r\nIn Stibbe\u2019s case, one of the biggest challenges facing law practitioners in recent years has been retrieving information from many different sources. Across the firm, lawyers and staff members need to find information stored in various information silos, including SharePoint knowledge bases, document management systems, and large Outlook mailboxes.\r\n\r\n<section class=\"text-block pt-none pb-none bg-is-white\">\r\n<div class=\"container-xl\">\r\n<div class=\"row justify-content-center aos-init aos-animate\" data-aos=\"fade-up\" data-aos-anchor-placement=\"top-bottom\" data-aos-easing=\"linear\" data-aos-duration=\"1000\">\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-9\">\r\n<h3>Solution</h3>\r\nTo overcome this challenge, Stibbe developed an all-encompassing search application using Sinequa\u2019s Cognitive Search &amp; Analytics platform, which provides secure, unified access to millions of documents and legal matters. Stibbe opted for Sinequa\u2019s platform in part because of the focus on world-class natural language processing, which accurately interprets the meaning of both the search query as well as the content, for superior search relevance and knowledge discovery. Furthermore, Sinequa\u2019s reputation as a proven provider of high-value search applications that are embedded within critical business processes was one of the reasons to choose Sinequa as preferred supplier.\r\n\r\nStibbe\u2019s lawyers have come to trust the Sinequa-powered application to ensure they are getting a holistic view of the information landscape, whether they are doing discovery along topical lines or looking for something specific to a particular case or client. This holistic view allows lawyers not only to find the information they need to do their jobs more readily, but also ensures that they are getting the full picture of the relevant topic(s) from across the organization.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</section><section class=\"text-block pt-none pb-sm bg-is-white\">\r\n<div class=\"container-xl\">\r\n<div class=\"row justify-content-center aos-init aos-animate\" data-aos=\"fade-up\" data-aos-anchor-placement=\"top-bottom\" data-aos-easing=\"linear\" data-aos-duration=\"1000\">\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-9\">\r\n<h3>Outcomes</h3>\r\nThe production application enables Stibbe\u2019s lawyers and staff members to work more productively by making it easy to find information.\r\n\r\nThe application also helps with information security, as it exposes improper storage of sensitive material. The power and thoroughness of the application enables the organization to practice proper document management, which has resulted in enhanced internal protection of sensitive (client) information.\r\n\r\nThe application is also accelerating compliance with the GDPR regulations since it enables stakeholders to search all documents where a specific client is mentioned, including electronic mailboxes. Stibbe realizes that successfully complying with the GDPR requirements begins with finding and understanding the data held by the organization.\r\n\r\n<strong>For more information, visit <a href=\"https://www.sinequa.com/solutions/legal-work/\">Sinequa for Legal work\u00a0</a></strong>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</section>",

Available April 14, Litera One eliminates fragmentation in legal work by creating continuous GenAI-enhanced workflows, allowing lawyers to draft, analyze documents, evaluate market insights, and access client matter data and knowledge management all within a single ecosystem across any device. This innovative solution enhances efficiency and eliminates the need to step outside native workflows.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhile most legal tech providers offer point solutions and AI that address isolated challenges, Litera One is the first to truly connect firm performance, knowledge management, drafting, and review directly where our customers are already doing their work,\" said Avaneesh Marwaha, CEO of Litera. \"With Litera One, we are eliminating the need for lawyers to switch between up to seven different applications when working on a single matter, dramatically improving accuracy and consistency.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt the core of Litera One is Litera AI+, a secure, purpose-built generative AI solution engineered specifically for legal workflows and integrated with Microsoft Azure's OpenAI services. Unlike generic AI tools retrofitted for legal use, Litera AI+ for Drafting understands legal context and connects directly with Litera solutions, such as Litera Compare, Contract Companion, and DocXtools Companion, to create a continuous intelligence layer across the entire document lifecycle.\r\n\r\n\"What sets Litera AI+ apart from other legal AI solutions is its deep integration throughout the entire workflow,\" said Adam Ryan, Litera's Chief Product Officer. \"Rather than simply offering AI capabilities as a standalone feature, we've embedded intelligence at every step of the legal workflow process. This connected approach means the system learns and improves as it moves between tasks, such as drafting, review, and analysis, while maintaining the highest security standards to protect sensitive client information.\"\r\n\r\nThe unified Litera One solution delivers substantial advantages for firms of all sizes:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>Connected Workflows:</strong> Eliminate friction between drafting, review, knowledge management, and firm performance with the only platform that maintains context across all phases of legal work.</li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Contextual Intelligence:</strong> Save valuable time with AI that remembers previous edits, understands firm practices, and applies learnings across the entire legal work lifecycle.</li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Universal Accessibility:</strong> Access the complete Litera toolkit across any device or operating system without interrupting your workflow or forcing context switches.</li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Collaborative Knowledge:</strong> Leverage institutional expertise and Litera AI+ insights directly within native workflows, reducing errors while ensuring consistency with firm standards.</li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Simplified Technology:</strong> Replace multiple standalone applications with a single, intuitive interface that requires minimal training and delivers faster startup times for Word and Outlook.</li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Rapid ROI:</strong> Achieve a timely measurable return on investment through reduced IT overhead, simplified deployment, and immediate productivity gains.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe initial Litera One release delivers cloud-based versions of Litera's essential drafting tools: Litera Compare, Contract Companion, and DocXtools Companion. Customers can run both desktop and SaaS versions simultaneously, allowing for flexible adoption. Upcoming releases will integrate Kira, Litera Transact, Litera Draft, Foundation, Foundation Insights, Foundation Finance, Foundation Scoping, and Foundation Clients, creating the industry's only truly end-to-end connected legal workflow.\r\n\r\nLitera developed Litera One in collaboration with over 30 beta customers, ensuring the platform addresses real-world needs. Tim Zgraggen, Technology Training and Digital Adoption Consultant for the Americas at Linklaters LLP, reported: \"Throughout our collaboration, Litera listened intently to our feedback and addressed our concerns and suggestions, ensuring the solution met our unique needs. This partnership resulted in an interface that allows our team to focus on high-value tasks by simplifying complex processes, so we can both enhance productivity and deliver the highest quality of work to our clients.\"\r\n\r\n<strong>Experience Litera One</strong>\r\n\r\nJoin Litera's CEO, Avaneesh Marwaha, for a demonstration of Litera One at <a href=\"https://www.litera.com/legalweek\">Legalweek 2025</a> on <strong>Tuesday, March 25 at 3:30 PM ET</strong>.

    "social_media_description": "<h3><em>Learn key strategies to enhance efficiency and innovation in legal operations.</em></h3>\r\nOn the wild ride that is currently the rollercoaster of legal tech, enterprise-level legal leaders find themselves navigating a complex balance between pressure to innovate and practical implementation challenges. Our recent survey of deputy general counsel (DGCs) reveals interesting\u2014yet alarming\u2014insights into how legal departments are approaching legal GenAI adoption, training, and success measurement.\r\n<h2>The Pressure to Innovate vs. Real-World Barriers</h2>\r\nWhile pressure to digitize mounts\u2014with 88% of legal professionals feeling compelled to adopt new tools \u2013 the landscape remains fraught with challenges. This pressure creates a challenging dynamic as legal departments face significant implementation hurdles.\r\n\r\nCompliance and regulatory risks top the list of concerns with almost half of all legal leaders (42%) expressing concern, followed closely by questions about business case justification (40%) and the irreplaceability of human judgment (40%). The human element remains a crucial factor, with 39% of departments also reporting they\u2019ve experienced staff resistance to adoption of new technology. These staff and infrastructure limitations indicate that successful implementation requires technological solutions tightly coupled with change management strategies.\r\n<h3>Training: A Critical Gap in GenAI Implementation</h3>\r\nThe survey reveals a troubling paradox in AI training for legal work. While nearly all legal departments (98%) provide some form of legal AI training,\u00a0less than half (43%) believe their training effectively prepares teams for legal work. This gap between training provision and effectiveness suggests a need for more targeted, specialized approaches to GenAI education in legal contexts.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.axiomlaw.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Copy%20of%20Blog%202%20Stats%20Template%20(1)-1.png?width=1877&amp;height=680&amp;name=Copy%20of%20Blog%202%20Stats%20Template%20(1)-1.png\" alt=\"98% of legal departments provide some form of legal AI training\" width=\"1877\" height=\"680\" />\r\n\r\nRegional differences add another layer of complexity to this picture, with U.K. legal departments showing a stronger tendency toward in-house training (68%) compared to their U.S. counterparts (48%). This disparity might reflect different approaches to technology adoption and training across legal cultures.\r\n<h3>AI Risk Awareness and Mitigation</h3>\r\nResearch shows widespread acceptance of\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.axiomlaw.com/blog/ai-in-legal-departments-promise-meets-reality\" rel=\"noopener\">AI in legal departments</a>, with 94% of Deputy General Counsel seeing benefits outweighing risks. Yet leaders remain clear-eyed about challenges\u2014cybersecurity (44%) and data privacy (43%) top their concerns, followed by intellectual property issues (40%) and workforce impact (38%). This balanced view suggests legal teams are taking a mature approach, recognizing both AI's transformative potential and its current limitations.\r\n<h3>Want to Know if Your Legal AI is Working? Here's What Legal Teams Are Tracking</h3>\r\nWhen it comes to measuring AI success, legal departments aren't just watching the bottom line. While 47% track efficiency and cost savings, the story runs deeper. Quality metrics matter too\u2014especially in the U.K., where 52% of teams prioritize work quality versus 29% in the U.S. Meanwhile, U.S. legal departments keep a closer eye on business impact (39% vs 29% in the U.K.).\r\n<h3>The Future of Legal AI: Measured Steps, Long-Term Vision</h3>\r\nLegal teams are charting a strategic path forward with AI \u2013 one that prioritizes strong foundations over quick wins. This year\u2019s DGC survey suggests legal teams\u2019 success hinges on building robust\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.axiomlaw.com/practice-areas/artificial-intelligence\" rel=\"noopener\">AI risk management</a>\u00a0and training programs before scaling implementation.\r\n\r\nFor legal departments considering or expanding their legal AI initiatives, the research suggests that success focusing on creating frameworks that manage risks, deliver effective training, and track diverse success metrics. This thoughtful approach, backed by widespread optimism, points to AI becoming a core, well-integrated\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.axiomlaw.com/blog/leveraging-ai-legal-operations\" rel=\"noopener\">part of legal operations</a>.",

    "short_description": "The Hidden Costs of Digital Maturity in Legal Teams",
    "social_media_description": "In an era where digital transformation dominates the legal industry narrative, a surprising paradox has emerged: the most technologically advanced legal teams are also the most stressed and likely to seek new opportunities. This revelation comes from comprehensive research examining legal teams' experiences with embracing the new digital landscape.\r\n<h2>The Digital Transformation Landscape</h2>\r\nCompanies are investing billions in legal technology\u2014from AI-powered legal assistants to contract lifecycle management systems and predictive analytics. The promise? Improved productivity, reduced costs, and streamlined workflows. But the reality is more complex.\r\n\r\nWe decided to conduct research to determine if legal tech is helping or hurting legal teams through its impact on productivity, efficiency, effectiveness, budgets, team well-being, and human resourcing. In our recent survey of in-house legal leaders, the analysis revealed three distinct categories of digital maturity, each with its own challenges and advantages. While the survey recipients were among Australian legal departments, the findings have resonated with legal leaders from other regions across the globe.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.axiomlaw.com/hs-fs/hubfs/DIgital%20Maturity%203%20Stats.png?width=1877&amp;height=680&amp;name=DIgital%20Maturity%203%20Stats.png\" alt=\"DIgital Maturity 3 Stats\" width=\"1877\" height=\"680\" />\r\n<h3>1. The Digitally Mature</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Operate with the smallest, most efficient teams</li>\r\n \t<li>Demonstrate highest productivity levels</li>\r\n \t<li>Face significant stress levels and retention challenges</li>\r\n \t<li>The majority plan to invest in FTEs, ALSPs, and legal ops to manage workload</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>2. The Digital Center</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Represent the majority of legal departments</li>\r\n \t<li>Maintain large, productive teams</li>\r\n \t<li>Underutilize available legal tech</li>\r\n \t<li>Increasing budgets for FTEs, outside counsel, and ALSPs</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>3. The Digital Center</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Report lowest productivity and largest teams</li>\r\n \t<li>Show slowest budget growth</li>\r\n \t<li>Experience least stress yet highest satisfaction</li>\r\n \t<li>Struggle with resource allocation despite team size</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>The Efficiency Paradox</h2>\r\nWhile the research found legal technology does make legal teams more productive, efficient in providing legal services, and aligned to the business, it revealed the impact of digital maturity has a business cost, too: The more digitally mature a team gets, the greater the stress on the in-house legal team, and the greater the motivation among individual lawyers and legal professionals to find a more rewarding career path.\r\n\r\nWhy do the most digitally mature teams face higher stress levels? The answer lies in work distribution. We think stress is high because low-value work is being handled or aided by AI, leaving the high-value, long hours, high-stress matters as the day-to-day work the humans are left to deal with.\r\n<h2>Finding Balance</h2>\r\nThe research suggests that peak efficiency shouldn't come at the cost of team well-being. A balanced approach to digital maturity involves:\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li>Strategic resource allocation across FTEs, ALSPs, law firms, and legal ops</li>\r\n \t<li>Thoughtful implementation of technology to support rather than overwhelm teams, especially with routine tasks</li>\r\n \t<li>Recognition that the smallest team isn't necessarily the optimal team, and that the largest team isn\u2019t always the most productive</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nIndeed, 59% of digitally mature teams plan to invest more in FTEs, ALSPs, and legal ops\u2014in that order\u2014to scale their capacity (and hopefully reduce their stress).\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.axiomlaw.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Copy%20of%20Blog%201%20Stat%20Template%20(2).png?width=1877&amp;height=680&amp;name=Copy%20of%20Blog%201%20Stat%20Template%20(2).png\" alt=\"Copy of Blog 1 Stat Template (2)\" width=\"1877\" height=\"680\" />\r\n<h2>Moving Forward</h2>\r\nFor legal departments navigating digital transformation, success lies in finding the sweet spot between technological adoption and human well-being. Putting together the right combination of technology and talent has become critical to building a high-performing in-house team that will thrive over the long haul.\r\n\r\nThe goal isn't just to be digitally mature \u2013 it's to create an environment where technology enhances both efficiency and job satisfaction. This requires careful consideration of how digital tools are implemented and what support structures need to be in place to maintain team well-being.\r\n\r\nTo counter increasing stress levels and workload challenges, legal teams across all maturity levels are complementing their legal tech investments with investments in FTEs, outside counsel, and flexible legal talent providers like Axiom. The research shows that even digitally immature teams recognize their position and are increasing investments in legal tech while also leaning on outside counsel and ALSPs to support their in-house lawyers and legal professionals. Teams in the digital center continue to invest in legal tech while relying on outside counsel and ALSPs to compensate for talent gaps and capacity constraints\r\n\r\nEfficiency that helps create a rewarding environment that meets business goals? That\u2019s the digitally mature organization we all want to work in.\r\n\r\n<em>*Axiom commissioned InsightDynamo, a leading market research organization, to survey 200 in-house legal leaders across Australia to understand the implications of digital maturity on today's legal teams.</em>",

Hyperlize enables legal professionals to identify missing hyperlinked documents and validate load file integrity with unprecedented efficiency, ensuring compliance with electronic discovery best practices.\r\n\r\nWhen handling productions in discovery, receiving parties often find themselves burdened with incomplete or unusable data. A newer challenge has been the lack of support in eDiscovery platforms for hyperlinked content, leading to missing documents and compliance issues that may not be discovered until weeks or months later. Hyperlize solves this problem by analyzing production data in real-time and generating actionable reports that identify missing hyperlinked documents and formatting errors before they become costly setbacks.\r\n\r\n\u201cHyperlize represents Cloudficient\u2019s commitment to delivering innovative solutions that address the evolving challenges of eDiscovery,\u201d says Brandon D\u2019Agostino, VP of Product at Cloudficient. \u201cBy giving litigation teams the ability to quickly analyze productions and identify gaps in document disclosures, we\u2019re empowering firms to take control of the discovery process and avoid unnecessary disputes or delays.\u201d\r\n\r\nHyperlize is tailored specifically for litigation professionals who aim to uphold the highest standards in eDiscovery without compromising on efficiency. This robust, user-friendly platform allows them to:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>Validate production accuracy.</strong>\u00a0Analyze received data to detect any hyperlinked documents that were referenced but omitted in productions.</li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Expedite discovery processes.</strong>\u00a0Generate detailed, actionable reports to support supplemental discovery requests before critical deadlines.</li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Enhance compliance.</strong>\u00a0Ensure adherence to established ESI protocol specifications, such as producing complex files in their native format.</li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Simplify workflows.</strong>\u00a0A point-and-click interface makes data validation and load file analysis seamless.</li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Scale accessibility.</strong>\u00a0Flexible pricing models allow firms of all sizes to adopt Hyperlize with ease, using it on a per-case basis or through enterprise subscriptions.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nHyperlize helps legal professionals avoid costly delays by identifying gaps in productions, streamlining data ingestion into review platforms, and ensuring compliance with industry standards.\r\n\r\nCloudficient will offer live demonstrations of Hyperlize during Legalweek at booth 1305.",

The integrated solution helps legal professionals conduct research and eDiscovery with accuracy, minimizing errors and misinformation. Its AI-powered search, built for lawyers, retrieves relevant case law, contracts, and compliance records, grounding responses in verified sources. Sinequa leverages Matter360 to view all information relevant to a particular matter\u2014including related documents, regulations, matters, meeting notes, expertise, and more.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to legal domain translations, quality and accuracy are of paramount importance. A mistranslation error can be egregious, causing legal liability and jeopardizing case proceedings. Systran\u2019s specialized AI translation is purpose-built for specific domains that require precise terminology and deep subject matter expertise, ensuring high quality and accurate output. In contrast, generic and commoditized translation solutions, such as those using LLMs, are not domain-specific and have a high risk of hallucination. The latest models from leading LLM providers hallucinate 61.8 percent of the time, based on their own benchmarks.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</section><section class=\"text-block pt-none pb-none bg-is-white\">\r\n<div class=\"container-xl\">\r\n<div class=\"row justify-content-center aos-init aos-animate\" data-aos=\"fade-up\" data-aos-anchor-placement=\"top-bottom\" data-aos-easing=\"linear\" data-aos-duration=\"1000\">\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-9\">\r\n<h2>Visit Sinequa &amp; Systran at LegalWeek 2025</h2>\r\nVisit\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.sinequa.com/resources/events/legalweek-2025/\">booth 3301</a>\u00a0at\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.event.law.com/legalweek\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LegalWeek 2025</a>\u00a0to learn why leading global law firms, including Skadden, Stibbe, and eDiscovery service providers such as Consilio and TCS Consulting trust Sinequa and Systran to streamline legal workflows and investigations by securely processing vast amounts of multilingual data, enabling legal teams to navigate complex cross-border disputes effortlessly.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</section><section class=\"text-block pt-none pb-none bg-is-white\">\r\n<div class=\"container-xl\">\r\n<div class=\"row justify-content-center aos-init aos-animate\" data-aos=\"fade-up\" data-aos-anchor-placement=\"top-bottom\" data-aos-easing=\"linear\" data-aos-duration=\"1000\">\r\n<div class=\"col-lg-9\">\r\n<h3>About Sinequa by ChapsVision</h3>\r\nSinequa transforms how work gets done.

    "short_description": "Consilio Launches Aurora, a Revolutionary Digital Enterprise Platform for Legal Data Management",
    "social_media_description": "<em>Transformative solution eliminates forced platform choices while enabling unified control and enhanced data visibility across eDiscovery matters</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>WASHINGTON, D.C., March 18, 2025</strong> \u2013 Consilio, the global leader in legal technology solutions and enterprise legal services, today announced the launch of Aurora, a groundbreaking Digital Enterprise Platform that transforms how legal teams manage legal data and eliminates the traditional compromise between standardizing on a single platform and fragmenting across multiple review solutions, providing unprecedented freedom of choice while maintaining unified control.\r\n\r\nIn today's legal technology landscape, organizations face escalating data volumes and complexity while resources remain constrained. In fact, according to a recent Consilio <a href=\"https://www.consilio.com/resource/consilio-survey-finds-60--of-legal-risk-and-compliance-professionals-currently-prioritizing-operational-reinventions-to-address-increasing-workload-challenges\">survey</a>, 48% of legal teams ranked overwhelming work volume as the biggest challenge they are facing.\u00a0 Aurora addresses these challenges by providing a comprehensive solution that sits upstream of review platforms, enabling legal teams to leverage the best review and legal productivity tools for each matter while maintaining portfolio-wide visibility and control. Successful AI adoption also remains a challenge, with 85% of law firms in some stage of AI exploration in areas like document review but only 5% reaching full deployment.\r\n\r\n\"For too long, legal teams have faced an impossible choice between standardization requirements that limit flexibility or fragmentation and reduced efficiency,\" said Meredith Kildow, President of Consilio. \"This false dilemma for legal departments is eliminated by Aurora. Our new Digital Enterprise Platform gives clients complete visibility into their portfolio of projects, unifies all their legal services work in one place, and provides a powerful data repository they can explore with sophisticated early case intelligence and AI capabilities. This represents a fundamental shift in how legal teams interact with their data and technology stack unlocking value for the organization as a whole.\"\r\n\r\n<strong>Aurora's innovative architecture fills the critical gap between enterprise data creation and review platforms</strong>, providing a unified management layer that transforms scattered data and fragmented workflows into strategic assets.\r\n\r\n\"In my conversations with clients, I consistently hear about the frustrations caused by data trapped in disparate platforms and repositories,\" said Michael Pontrelli, Client Experience Officer at Consilio. \"Aurora changes that paradigm completely. By providing a single point of control and visibility across their entire portfolio, legal teams can track the progress of all matters, manage resources efficiently, and access powerful cross-project insights from one intuitive interface. This democratizes access to the immense scale and sophistication of data processing that was previously only available through bespoke engagements. We're providing a new blueprint for legal data management that prioritizes freedom, control, and success.\"\r\n\r\nKey features of Aurora include:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>Aurora DataCore</strong> \u2013 A reusable data repository that transforms scattered information into a unified, searchable knowledge base, enabling unprecedented efficiency through work product reuse</li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Aurora Portal</strong> \u2013 Provides complete transparency and control across all review platforms and matters with real-time visibility and powerful analytics</li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Aurora CoreECI (Early Case Intelligence)</strong> \u2013 Delivers powerful early case assessment capabilities with advanced searching and filtering, enabling rapid, data-driven decisions from day one</li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Aurora AI Solutions Suite</strong> \u2013 Includes AI Investigate for smart searching and AI Summarize for automated document summarization, with more capabilities planned</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBuilt on Consilio's private cloud infrastructure, Aurora addresses growing concerns about data sovereignty and unpredictable costs associated with public cloud deployments.\r\n\r\n\"We understand the critical importance of data security, sovereignty, and cost predictability,\" said Raj Chandrasekar, Chief Technology and Innovation Officer at Consilio. \"Aurora's architecture leverages our highly scalable private cloud infrastructure, giving clients the confidence of enterprise-grade protection without the unpredictable costs of public cloud services. At the heart of Aurora is our proprietary DataCore technology\u2014the culmination of over a decade of continuous refinement\u2014which actively processes, enriches, and structures data, transforming raw information into a powerful asset primed for advanced analysis and reuse.\"\r\n\r\nAurora is currently available to select Consilio clients and will have general availability in the coming months. Legal professionals can experience Aurora firsthand at Legalweek 2025 from March 24-27, where Consilio will be exhibiting and providing demonstrations of the platform's capabilities or register for a product preview webinar on April 4.\r\n\r\n\"With Aurora, we're not just giving clients a new platform\u2014we're providing a new paradigm for legal data management that prioritizes freedom, control, and success,\" added Pontrelli. \"It's about transforming your legal enterprise to spend less time wrestling with data and more time extracting valuable insights.\"\r\n\r\nFor more information on Aurora, please visit <a href=\"https://www.consilio.com/technology/aurora\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">www.consilio.com/aurora</a>.\r\n\r\n<strong>About Consilio</strong>\r\n\r\nConsilio stands as the global leader in eDiscovery, document review, flexible legal talent, and legal advisory &amp; transformation consulting services.

    "social_media_description": "<strong>AI advancement empowers lawyers and litigation teams to reduce their workload, gain every advantage, and master the facts when working across sets of case documents</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>LONDON, UK \u2013 24 March 2025 \u2013</strong> Today, <a href=\"https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4389054-1&amp;h=2219772198&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fopus2.com%2F&amp;a=leading+legal+software+and+services+provider+Opus+2\">leading legal software and services provider Opus 2</a> announced the company\u2019s spring product release and AI Workbench, which is seamlessly built into its award-winning legal case management software, Opus 2 Cases.\r\n\r\nAI Workbench empowers lawyers and litigation teams to quickly develop case strategy using generative AI to analyse, summarise, and query sets of multiple case documents. Legal professionals also can chat with AI to quickly uncover deeper insights and organise relevant facts and details to shape strategy faster.\r\n\r\n\u201cWorking closely with clients, our goal was to create an intuitive, AI-driven workspace where legal professionals can find evidence, build arguments, and extract insights from sets of case documents with unprecedented speed and accuracy,\u201d said Liza Pestillos-Ocat, Senior Vice President of Global Client Success at Opus 2. \u201cAI Workbench does just that, seamlessly connecting the powerful capabilities of our award-winning case management software with the productivity benefits of generative AI.\u201d\r\n\r\nAI Workbench expands on Opus 2\u2019s well-received first phase of AI technology launched last year. While Opus 2 Cases has always empowered firms to be more collaborative, efficient, and successful, AI Workbench elevates the case management, strategy, analysis, and preparation solution to a new level\u2014applying generative AI functionality where it is most valuable for lawyers and litigation teams.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe response to our latest innovations has been incredible, fueling our momentum and expanding our reach across the disputes landscape,\u201d said Greg Blackman, CEO at Opus 2. \u201cWith each new offering, we\u2019re redefining how legal professionals approach large and small cases, setting new standards for efficiency and collaboration.\u201d\r\n\r\nAI Workbench helps litigation teams process large amounts of information quickly, sense-check their case strategy, and improve decision-making. When users open AI Workbench, they get a complete view of the people, events, organisations, and legal topics contained inside a set of case documents. They can review sourced AI summaries of each and connect the relevant facts to their chronology, witness list, and other case management workflows already within Opus 2. Users also can chat with the query tool in AI workbench using everyday language to get deeper insights from the content inside the set of case documents, revealing crucial details, patterns, conclusions, and more.\r\n\r\nDozens of leading law firms who are clients participated in testing and iterating on the company\u2019s AI offerings, including AI Workbench. Several clients also compared it with other legal-focused AI tools in the market, preferring Opus 2\u2019s results and approach.\r\n\r\nNorton Rose Fulbright US LLP, longtime user of Opus 2, has implemented Opus 2\u2019s advanced AI technology that automatically generates multiple types of summaries of deposition transcripts and documents and enables generative AI querying.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis game-changing innovation significantly enhances the speed and efficiency of digesting deposition transcripts, making the process more cost-effective and efficient compared to traditional human summaries,\u201d said Florinda Baldridge, Director, Global eDiscovery Services at Norton Rose Fulbright. \"Our clients will benefit from quicker insights and streamlined workflows, reinforcing our commitment to delivering cutting-edge and cost-effective solutions.\"\r\n\r\nThe spring release includes numerous developments including updates to transcript management workflows, enhanced exports, and user interface improvements.\r\n\r\nAI Workbench is a major step forward in the company\u2019s ongoing work to ensure AI is adding value to litigators throughout the case lifecycle. In looking at use cases for AI throughout the litigation lifecycle, Opus 2 has published, <a href=\"https://www.opus2.com/en-us/essential-tips-for-harnessing-ai/\"><em>Harnessing AI for legal case strategy: Essential tips for litigation teams</em></a>, which features 20 ways to use AI for litigation.\r\n\r\nFind out more about Opus 2 Cases by meeting with the team at <a href=\"https://go.opus2.com/legalweek-2025\">Legalweek in New York, March 24-27</a>. Opus 2 will be at booth 2120 in America\u2019s Hall 1.\r\n\r\n<strong>About Opus 2</strong>\r\n\r\nFor more than 15 years, Opus 2 has developed award-winning solutions trusted by the most successful law firms.

    "social_media_description": "<strong>Advancements in iManage AI Set New Standard in Delivering </strong><strong>Smarter, Faster, Safer Legal Work</strong>\r\n\r\n<em>Powerful updates to Ask iManage, Insight+ empower customers to leverage AI in a practical, frictionless, and secure way</em>\r\n\r\n<em>\u00a0</em>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://imanage.com/\">iManage</a>, the company dedicated to Making Knowledge Work\u2122, today unveiled further developments to its advanced AI strategy\u2014an embedded, comprehensive approach that helps knowledge workers leverage data more effectively, enhance search, and unlock institutional knowledge to drive smarter work and deliver value to their stakeholders in an efficient and safe way.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThis strategic direction incorporates the application of AI across the platform to enable customers to be better prepared to use AI technologies with their proprietary data. It also alleviates repetitive and mundane tasks, be that email filing or automatic creation of signature packets enabling users to focus on more productive, high value tasks. Supporting these advancements iManage announced new releases of <a href=\"https://imanage.com/imanage-products/the-imanage-platform/ai/ask-imanage/\">Ask iManage </a>and <a href=\"https://imanage.com/imanage-products/knowledge-search-management/insightplus/\">Insight+</a>, including the introduction of additional Gen AI capabilities.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Your AI-Powered Legal Assistant: Ask iManage</strong>\r\n\r\nLaunched in 2024, Ask iManage is an AI-powered assistant native to iManage Work, built to enhance how professionals work with documents, emails, and content. The latest release of Ask iManage introduces a guided actions interface making it easy for users to leverage the benefits of generative AI without the need to be experts in crafting prompts. Guided actions available today include:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>Overview</strong>, to quickly see the main points of content</li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Extract</strong>, to grab exact text and data points from documents</li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Summarize</strong>, to generate summaries for specific topics within content</li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Analyze</strong>, to check if content meets certain requirements</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAsk iManage already offers multi-document processing\u2014the ability to run guided actions on multiple documents simultaneously. This capability is beneficial for tasks such as due diligence, compliance reviews, or remediation projects.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA newly introduced question library lets users browse a curated set of prompts and save, customize, and reuse prompts for personal or team use. Dynamic question suggestions provide real-time, context-aware examples tailored specifically to a user\u2019s document.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAsk iManage is gaining momentum by delivering new value aligned with evolving user needs. It incorporates AI skills that can be seamlessly applied to documents and includes guardrails that enable users to easily verify the AI model's output as necessary. For example, a key feature is the ability to provide evidence and help users navigate to the precise location within a source document to verify a response. Users also benefit from greater flexibility in how answers are formatted, such as tables or lists, and in exporting those answers to familiar formats like Word or Excel, reducing friction and saving valuable time.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nRecognizing that training and adoption can be challenging, iManage developed the Wayfinder program. A consultative and high-touch customer engagement program to enable strong user adoption, the Wayfinder program supports customers in meeting their desired outcomes. Participation in the program continues to grow within the iManage customer base.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>\u00a0The next evolution of Knowledge Search built on a Strong Data Foundation</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\niManage is leading the way in Knowledge Search with semantic and generative search experiences built on trusted grounding data in their knowledge base. Insight+, based on a hybrid search index with security policy at its core, enables innovative AI-powered search to support lawyers in the ways they want to work. Using natural language, it searches for generative responses to questions grounded in managed collections of the organization's data, providing authoritative links to the underlying source content and document links.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nInsight+ has continued to gain significant traction in the market, in part due to the features and enhancements that have been realized in the last year and now has more than 25,000 active users globally across law firms, tax and accounting practices, and corporate legal departments.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\u201cAI is never about \u2018AI for AI sake\u2019\u2014it\u2019s about getting to better outcomes,\u201d said Shawn Misquitta, EVP of Product Management at iManage. \u201cOur continued investments in the platform - iManage Insight+ and Ask iManage - play a crucial role in helping customers realize value, while leveraging AI in a secure and responsible way. The market response and adoption globally validate our approach. We are committed to helping customers achieve pragmatic, pervasive, and responsible use of AI technologies, and we\u2019re excited about the tremendous interest from our legal and corporate legal customers.\u201d\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\niManage is at Legalweek 2025 in New York City, March 24\u201327.

Five years on and firm leaders' would rather have staff back in the office full-time, but by and large junior partners and associates don\u2019t want to be there. This is a problem for firms, but not one caused by remote working per se, but that the issues really stem from firms not knowing how to manage remote working well.</em></p>\r\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"417\">It seems that the legal sector is currently struggling with the fact that leadership teams want people back in the office full time; but equally they know that trying to wean people off hybrid can cause lots of friction.

    "social_media_description": "<em>Next Generation Co-authoring capability eliminates friction and inefficiencies while letting customers stay in total control, driving maximum productivity</em><em>\u00a0</em>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://imanage.com/\">iManage</a>, the company dedicated to Making Knowledge Work\u2122, today announced that the Microsoft Co-authoring capability within the iManage knowledge Work platform is now generally available, enhancing collaboration for customers of all sizes, providing an easy way for knowledge workers to work on Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents simultaneously across teams.\r\n\r\nProfessionals can effortlessly collaborate on documents in real-time or at their own pace, with no need to wait for colleagues to finish before making forward progress. The ability to access and edit content on the iManage platform from anywhere, and co-author documents in real time, reduces friction around collaboration and boosts efficiency, security, and productivity.\r\n\r\n\u201cNext Generation co-authoring will serve as a powerful productivity driver for the iManage knowledge work platform,\u201d said Neil Araujo, CEO, iManage. \u201cBenefiting from our deep partnership with Microsoft allows us to give customers a new way to achieve seamless, secure, and efficient document collaboration, without disrupting their workflows or compromising security or compliance. We are pleased to see so many of our customers taking advantage of iManage and Microsoft Co-authoring to optimize their overall productivity and their ability to deliver the best tools to their workforce to collaborate safely and efficiently.\u201d\r\n\r\nAdditional key benefits of Microsoft Co-authoring include the ability to maintain full control and transparency while co-authoring, creating a worry-free user experience. Document revisions made in real time appear in the iManage timeline view, allowing document owners to instantly see who edited the file and when. Additionally, users can roll back to earlier revisions and catch in-between changes, correct errors, and refine content before locking in a new version. Most importantly, co-authoring is built natively into the iManage platform, so users can collaborate on content while retaining the industry-leading security and governance protections they expect from iManage.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Microsoft Co-authoring capability within iManage streamlines collaboration and provides a single source of truth,\u201d said Rob Howard, VP of Product Management, Microsoft 365. \u201cWhether teams work in real-time or asynchronously, Co-authoring offers multiple ways to identify and remove roadblocks on the way to a final version. Professionals can ask questions, request clarifications, and leave comments directly in the document, ensuring important context is in one place within the work product while reducing versioning challenges.\u201d\r\n\r\nPreviously offered as part of the iManage Early Access Program, Microsoft Co-authoring was used by more than 90 iManage customers, gathering valuable feedback that has helped refine and optimize the experience beginning on July 15, 2024. Now, with its general availability, even more organizations can leverage this powerful capability to enhance collaboration and productivity.",

This can lead to serious long-term consequences for the firm.</p>\r\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"734\">These can include chronic performance and commitment issues and flagging productivity, or its opposite, which is burnout. Without traditional levels of people visibility, managers are managing blind. Hence, firm leaders are trying to cajole partners and associates back into the office full time, while they\u2019re simultaneously wary of upsetting lawyers who\u2019re productive at home, and of being so heavy-handed with calls back to the office that talent leaves.</p>\r\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"734\">Read the full article <a href=\"https://belt.ai/stories/overcoming-the-problems-with-hybrid-working-and-getting-the-best-of-both-worlds\">here</a>.</p>",

In a hybrid world, we can add: \u201cYou can\u2019t manage what you can\u2019t see.\u201d Hybrid, remote, and dispersed working have become established and yet we\u2019ve also established that they create a core business problem. Managers are detached from their teams, they can no longer see what\u2019s going on. The result is that managers are driven to overmanage with too many meetings, too much communication and too much reliance on work management systems that were never designed to fill this particular role.</p>\r\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"507\">In the preceding article\u00a0<a title=\"#\" href=\"https://belt.ai/stories/overcoming-the-problems-with-hybrid-working-and-getting-the-best-of-both-worlds\" rel=\"noopener\" data-testid=\"link-with-safety\" data-renderer-mark=\"true\">[2]</a><em data-renderer-mark=\"true\">,\u00a0</em>I introduced an alternative way forward, which harnesses the power of AI-native software to give managers clear, real-time insights into the activities of remote workers. The idea is that by restoring visibility and control, those who want to work remotely still can, while at the same time their bosses can see and understand the work they\u2019re doing and manage people and teams appropriately and effectively once more.</p>\r\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"507\">Read the full article <a href=\"https://belt.ai/stories/taking-control-of-hybrid-work\">here</a>.</p>",

This anxiety primarily stems from the unknown. When legal professionals lack clarity about how changes will affect their workflows, productivity, and client service capabilities, resistance naturally follows.</p>\r\n<p id=\"ember421\" class=\"ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph\">What's the antidote to this resistance you ask? Education\u2026</p>\r\n<p id=\"ember422\" class=\"ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph\"><strong>Education: The Foundation of Successful Change Management</strong></p>\r\n<p id=\"ember423\" class=\"ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph\">For over 35 years, we at <a href=\"https://intellek.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Intellek</a>, have observed a clear pattern among law firms that successfully navigate technological and operational shifts: they prioritize comprehensive training programs that prepare their people for change before it happens. Taking a proactive approach to change, not reactive.</p>\r\n<p id=\"ember424\" class=\"ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph\">The most successful change initiatives in legal environments share a common first step: ensuring everyone understands not just what is changing, but why it matters and how it will benefit them.</p>\r\n<p id=\"ember425\" class=\"ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph\">Simply put, you cannot lead change if you don't know where you're going.</p>\r\n<p id=\"ember426\" class=\"ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph\"><strong>The Measurable Impact of Learning Technology in Legal</strong></p>\r\n<p id=\"ember427\" class=\"ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph\">The data tells a compelling story about how learning management systems are transforming legal education:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Firms implementing comprehensive learning platforms see an average <strong>264% increase in learning material usage</strong>, indicating stronger engagement with training resources</li>\r\n \t<li>Well-trained staff contribute significantly to <strong>firm-efficiency</strong> and <strong>profitability</strong></li>\r\n \t<li>Organizations prioritizing education experience substantial financial benefits, with <strong>$29,400 average savings in employee turnover costs</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p id=\"ember429\" class=\"ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph\"><strong>Building a Culture of Continuous Learning</strong></p>\r\n<p id=\"ember430\" class=\"ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph\">Leading law firms are shifting away from the traditional view of training of classroom based activities, for three-hours during onboarding, toward establishing ecosystems of continuous learning. This approach recognizes that adaptation isn't a destination but a journey.</p>\r\n<p id=\"ember431\" class=\"ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph\">Utilizing Intellek helps firms to address several critical challenges:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li><strong>New Hire Onboarding</strong>: Establishing consistent knowledge foundations for all staff</li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Technology Capability</strong>: Ensuring proficiency within essential legal tech tools</li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Continued Education</strong>: Supporting ongoing professional development</li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Performance Measurement</strong>: Providing analytics to identify knowledge gaps</li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Digital Adoption</strong>: Accelerating the implementation of new technologies</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<div class=\"reader-image-block reader-image-block--resize\">\r\n<figure class=\"reader-image-block__figure\">\r\n<div class=\"ivm-image-view-model \">\r\n<div class=\"ivm-view-attr__img-wrapper \"><img id=\"ember434\" class=\"ivm-view-attr__img--centered reader-image-block__img evi-image lazy-image ember-view\" src=\"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E12AQHdK7W8zxaxaA/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/B4EZXxlGIbHgAQ-/0/1743514788783?e=1749081600&amp;v=beta&amp;t=K49a2AOEmGaftGknVHg2u2mqoDqc6JcfkXhblV40I4s\" alt=\"\" /></div>\r\n</div></figure>\r\n</div>\r\n<p id=\"ember435\" class=\"ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph\"><strong>The Integrated Approach to Legal Learning</strong></p>\r\n<p id=\"ember436\" class=\"ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph\">Intellek\u2019s learning solutions go beyond conventional training methods by integrating multiple components:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>Intellek LMS</strong>: Centralizing all learning activities with in-depth tracking &amp; reporting</li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Intellek Learn</strong>: Providing access to over 1,400 courses used by law firms</li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Intellek Create</strong>: Enabling the development of tech-specific training</li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Intellek deliver</strong>: Delivering guidance within workflows and applications</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<div class=\"reader-image-block reader-image-block--resize\">\r\n<figure class=\"reader-image-block__figure\">\r\n<div class=\"ivm-image-view-model \">\r\n<div class=\"ivm-view-attr__img-wrapper \"><img id=\"ember439\" class=\"ivm-view-attr__img--centered reader-image-block__img evi-image lazy-image ember-view\" src=\"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E12AQEBkCcnvZL9Pw/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/B4EZXxlXxlHgAY-/0/1743514861183?e=1749081600&amp;v=beta&amp;t=cC1xb9_gViFUOZgZNLgjwxDcSQ66hDGumUnJO5dE6Lo\" alt=\"\" /></div>\r\n</div></figure>\r\n</div>\r\n<p id=\"ember440\" class=\"ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph\">This comprehensive approach creates a learning environment specifically designed to make change management more accessible and effective.</p>\r\n<p id=\"ember441\" class=\"ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph\"><strong>Education Within Workflow</strong></p>\r\n<p id=\"ember442\" class=\"ember-view reader-text-block__paragraph\">Perhaps the most significant evolution in <a href=\"https://www.theedgeroom.com/2025/03/26/level-up-your-legaltech-game-with-a-whole-free-month-of-access-to-intellek-skillshub/\">legal training</a> is the shift toward delivering education within existing workflows.
